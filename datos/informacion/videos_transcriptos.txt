kia ora Koutou and welcome to sagrada in about three minutes
it has a solo mode
it's a game for 1-4 players, playing time is medium and it's a pretty simple game
stained glass windows are artistic works of great difficulty
you are an artisan attempting to make your masterpiece but you are not alone
other artisans are competing against you
can you manage your supplies and tools and make the most wondrous stained  glass window?
you will mark the end of each round using a die
when 10 rounds are up the game is over and the winner is the player with the most points
points are scored by completing public goals as well as your individual private goal
drafting: there are a central pool of dice that players alternate selecting from
dice: Sagrada is all about the shiny bright dice
each player takes a window board, a secret objective and two double-sided tile cards
select one of the tile cards to keep and gain the number of tool tokens shown in the bottom right
then slide the title card into the window board
there will be three public goals and three tools
make sure to be familiar with them before you start drafting dice
each turn revolves around the dice draft
roll a number of dice equal to two times the number of players plus one
so for four players this will be nine dice
blue is the first player so they select one of the dice
play proceeds around the table to green
green selects two dice and play reverses back around to blue
the leftover die is used to mark the turn
the first die you place must be on an edge but from here there are restrictions on where you can place
a die the same color or number cannot be placed above or beside
so these dice cannot be placed by the
green three
if a square shows a number in it only a die matching that number can be placed there
so the blue two can go on a two
a white space can have any die placed in it that does not break the previous rules
and only matching coloured dice can be placed in coloured squares
so using the rules above only one die can be placed in the middle four space here and that is a red four
we draft a red three but this lets us use  one of the available tool cards
we pay one tool token to use the card and change the three to a four
subsequent uses of a tool card would use two charges
if you ever accidentally break the placing rules you must remove those dice
once 10 rounds are up scoring takes place
you score the point shown in the bottom left of the goal for each time you achieve that goal
so in this example we score it twice
your private goal will always be the total value of one color
and finally lose one point for each empty square
why would you like this game
sagrada is a puzzle game for people who love spatial puzzles
and the rising tension of having your  available placement options get more and more limited as the game goes on
and that's the best part of sagrada
looking at the draft options and realizing that you have put yourself in a bad position
or the triumph of getting a row exactly right to match a goal
the tool cards give you different options on how to manipulate the game
and only three are included each time you play
and well it's simply a pretty looking game those shiny dice are really nice
the best thing about this game is when it all works well and you have a wonderful looking high scoring completed window
however, despite the myriad of tools, tiles and goals in the game if you don't like the core gameplay of drafting and placement
none of the changes will make the game work for you
there's also limited interaction
while drafting to hurt other players can happen you're far more likely to draft for your own needs first
like the mechanics but wish the game had swords and spells try roll player
and for a different type of pretty dice  rafting game try noctiluca
sagrada one pretty puzzle

he said you're ready internal affairs
hi I'm Stephanie straw with
boardgamegeek and I am joined by Ben
Harkins Oleg eight games haven we're
going to be talking about sigurado just
saying that I am very looking forward to
so please tell me about this amazing
game so sagrada is a game by Darrell
Andrews and then your designer Adrian
msq and this is a game of dice drafting
and window crafted you're building a
stained glass window I did that's very
intensive I appreciate that so in this
game each of us are artisans helping
complete the stained glass windows at
the Sagrada Familia the installation in
Barcelona okay so we start with our own
stained glass window that's an actual
place in our syllabus it has this
amazing stained glass you got it i
believe it was inspiration to the
designers yeah for for this game so it's
really great when a game kinda has the
theme girl up with the mechanic says
yeah as it's going so here we go we've
got each of the players that are going
to start with a window that has some
plans on it for where specific colors or
shades of dice need to go we've got
these little 3d printed prototype or a
prototype now I know everything here is
prototype the arts pretty darn close to
final but things could still change
gameplay wise what we do is each round
the star player grabs grabs dice pulls
them
and we're going to be taking turns
drafting these dice to place them on our
card let's say I was the star player I
can place tight nice on my card such
that you could place any die in a light
space or you have to end up matching the
colors or shade restrictions that are on
the dice Ben numbers you got a shade
represented by the pips on the dice see
you know what you want to pick that one
sure i'll pick that one and then
Stephanie go ahead and draft board I'm
gonna do
I think I'm gonna do this great matching
there and it's a snake draft so you
actually get to draft again yeah and I'm
going to take
this six from you super you'll have to
build out your window starting from the
from the spaces that you started on kind
of progressing out so it'll need to
touch you you said yep you got it thanks
that was that was on purpose i know i
mean i'll give you the rules as you
break them you should i'm gonna take
this yelps you need more of those and
put that there very good and then now
yeah I'm kind of stuck here but I'm
gonna try and go with this purple and
meet that requirement drink you're gonna
build out you got it so that's the end
of the drafting we're going to take the
the final die and that goes on around
track which I don't have here and so
there's ten rounds in the game you can
notice that we each draft two dice for
around and we'll be building out our
windows mm-hmm a couple things about
that first of all why in the world are
we doing this we're dating this cuz it's
fun this one done already exactly the
goal of the game is to gain victory
points we've got variable victory point
conditions per game so we've got three
different ones that are out here roll
color varieties so for every row that
you don't have repeated colors you're
going to gain six points at the end of
the game for every column that doesn't
have repeated shades the number on the
die you're getting there are these five
colors in there right you got it only
five colors and then for each for the
longer diagonals that you have on your
board where where the colors are
touching yeah you're going to gain
points for how long those are ya so
we're going to eat to be working toward
these private objective are these public
objectives reach also going to start
with a public and a private objective
card okay that will keep secret from our
opponents please give us on their
private yep these give us a color to
strive to strive for and we're going to
count the number of pips of that color
at the end of the game so okay we all
no what we're each going for on the in
the public realm but then we each have a
and after I wanna type in blue you got a
sin my window as you're keeping that in
mind for the other goals so now we'll
pass on to the next round the whole dice
bag passes to the player on the left
yeah and now you'll draw five dice in a
two-player game and roll bows lots of
blues that's good for me good for you
but I don't know that yeah great and now
you'll stuck the draft yeah and so I
still have to be touching your diagonal
tech diagonals just fine okay however
there's a rule where you can never have
two dice next to each other of the same
color or the same number okay so i could
not place these two next to each other
you got it cuz they're both blue I'm you
got it I'm gonna do that I can I that
perfectly fine and then you'll get to go
twice yeah I'll get to go twice I'm
gonna do a diagonal move as well I'm
gonna try and jump over here just to
kind of give myself quite a few options
as we're branching out yeah and all the
draft is back to you
and you'll notice that as you're
drafting these nice you start to get a
many more restrictions on the board with
what's allowed to be placed where yeah
actually stone in this though you got it
okay I'm gonna give myself more options
exactly spread out but you'll notice
since we require a red dye there by
placing a red x next to it but I can't
oh I can't place a run at all yeah you
won't be able to place the red dye next
to that square in my future gotcha yeah
so not such ever or color exactly why
can I not place that there yeah because
because there are two fives next to each
other again I know I know oh this is a
perfectly valid move and i would suggest
actually doing that lap into that yeah I
think that's my only mode so in the
future you're gonna you're gonna need to
put a red dye there it's perfectly fine
to do that now so you'll end up in these
tight situations I won't be able to
better read there exactly so to help
mitigate that we have these tour cards
ok are available here and that was my
Segway that was on purpose well done
so each player starts with some of these
favorite segments and these help you
break the rules and interesting ways so
what you can do in the future spend one
of those tokens to use this Egla mice
brush where you can move one of your
dice and avoid the color restriction
that's on your window okay you'll spend
these if you're the first player to use
it you'll spend one and once there's a
one of these tokens on there it costs
any other player two of the tokens to
use it so you're encouraged to use it
exactly and you're encouraged to use
them early and not really you got it
maybe not as often okay so we've got a
whole bunch of these variable tools that
help guide your strategy as you're going
and give you ways to manipulate the
gameplay that way so as you can see
we're going to draft to die spur round
that guy goes back to the round trip and
the dice bag passes and you don't get to
go again you got it and you play through
that plank your challenge until you win
yeah by having the most points exactly
which you're you're well on the way to
winning count the points by this yet
you'll tally up points for each of the
three public scoring industry how much
what the score is so this one kind of
depends on how many help yep you're
working your way to a diagonal here and
we look at column shade variety which
would depend on how how you fill out
your
your window as you go and then likewise
40 color variety you have a little
scouring pad where you'll tally up your
score yeah highest scoring players the
winner yeah and it's just these this is
the only points there's nothing else
aside from that you'll you'll lose
points for each space that you're
missing on air on your window so it
encourages you to fill it up plus it's
just a really satisfying feeling to fill
out your whole stained glass window
exactly how many points do you loose
just one for free treats its square and
I'd love to show that these window
frames are gonna be a large spire yeah i
was looking at earlier yeah each of the
each of the window patterns is going to
be a doubled up card with four different
difficulties so you'll be able to select
early on how how difficult you want the
game to be getting more favor tokens for
playing a more difficult card and these
will slide right in and give you the
little lettuce to build with it as you
go and that is so cool thanks we're
really happy with this one I have talked
about this thank you I I'm gonna rock
this game so we're gonna be on
Kickstarter starting mid-september and I
would really love to have everyone's
support as a backward do you have
anything special you're doing for
kickstarter I've got some plans nothing
ready to announce yeah
like just a little bit maybe just a
little something we're planning on
having a deluxe version that might be
pretty fancy so it's that's the most i
can share right now awesome and ting
starter win sep tember 12 is the plane

[Music]
hey everybody and welcome to bits of
border we're talking board games
miniatures cards and dice my name is
Michael and today we're going to be
checking out sagrada now this is one of
my most recent Kickstarter arrivals and
their game all about building beautiful
stained glass windows out of dice what
up and I don't know why I went for it on
Kickstarter it's a strange scene it's
probably not something I've ever thought
of but it was a beautiful looking game
and so simple so anyway so we're going
to be doing a quick unboxing of this one
and then we're going to go through an
example of what you might see in a game
and then we'll come back at the end and
have a chat all about it so let's uh
let's get stuck in all right guys this
is either my best or worst idea in the
world let's unbox sagrada we cared all
right let's have a nice good look at
that front color very pretty all right
let's stop until we got in here got our
rule book here not that many rules I
like that I like that oh man okay so got
a little counter here is very nicely
shiny ooh la la and here we have some of
our windows and these are wow so thick
so luscious this is beautiful Wow all
right look at these colors hey super
nice what else we got we've got a deck
of our window plans here we've got
go on yeah I'm not sure what's going on
here looks like a bag that once
contained some score trackers just alive
that on it all loose pieces which ever
works are there we go have a quite think
of those no let's not really but then
icicle got a little baggie that's cute
with a bigger bag with a very nice print
on there the Sagrada god I ok I was
affecting guy statistics too many died
and we got some other little glass
quickens here what else it up some more
cards we could be the player or the
powers that you can now pick up through
the games are the tools that you can use
and a very nice insert there to keep
everything organized you gotta love it
when everything just fits all right
that's the unboxing let's have a look at
the game ok so here we have our setup to
sagrada as you can see we've got two
player boards each complete with their
own little window design now these are
chosen fairly randomly out of a nice
stack that the game provides here we go
as you can see that I've done all
double-sided all different difficulty
men is a lot to play in there now each
player has got their own secret victory
point earning ability so this is the red
play here looks like they're going to be
going for red dice mainly but the other
player doesn't know that they have green
dice so they're going to be going for
greens and say we'll see how we go what
else we got dumb we've got favor tokens
here now these relate directly to the
difficulty of the chosen window design
so the more of these we've got the more
difficult your your window is going to
be to complete now these tie into some
of the tools that we've got floating
around here because when you're putting
your windows together you've got to
follow a couple of basic rules for
placement you can never have two dice of
the same color or the same value next to
each other sharing an edge and these
kind of allow you to either bro
those rules just a little bit or change
some of the dice positions that are
actually already in your window so every
time you want to use one of those you
take one of your favor tokens plonk it
on one of the tools up there and take
that ability what else we go we've got
our round tracker here there are ten
rounds for each game and finally we've
got some objected to objected cards that
are going to provide ways for players to
gain victory points at the end of the
game now these are shared everyone knows
about these ones as an example of what
we've got going on for every diagonal
line of colors that you've got you're
going to be gaining a point to that so
if this was a window display would be
getting three points for yellow and four
points for blue in the diagonal and here
we've got our column at shaved variety
now shades in this game are represented
by the number on the dice so we're going
for a column shade variety which means
that we want different numbers going in
each line so that's going to be
something players are going to want to
keep in mind and for every pair of three
and four value dice the player is going
to gain a two point so basically we're
going to be shooting for diagonals we're
going to be shooting third threes and
fours and we're going to shoot for
columns that have a different value in
each position rough so that's that sells
set up that's what these players are
going to be going for today and there
yeah so this is a dice trafficking game
so that is a lovely bag here that is
chock-full of dice you can see it as a
couple floating around in there so in a
two-player game we're going to be
grabbing the five dice that is two dice
for each player plus one and we'll show
you what so here is our first draw we've
got five dimes losing them eventually
roll them and let's start picking so the
red player will go first now he's
shooting for some red dice so there's a
couple of good ones there but he's got
some placement rules even in the
beginning you're only allowed to start
on a corner or an edge of space and
then move your dice out from there so
you've got to kind of grow you can't
just go placing them willy-nilly our red
player shooting for those red dice is
going to go for this one here and plunk
that in the corner here so that's his
first move player two going to check
this out we're going for greens over
here we know that so let's no greens of
easily so a bit stuffed but there is a
two down here in this corner and a two
floating around we might might as well
get that out of the way nice and early
now this is quite a good mood because
player doesn't alternate from player 1
player 2 player 1 player 2 players have
actually got a it goes down the line and
then comes back so in a three-player
game it would go player 1 2 3 3 2 1 so
in this case a two-player game the
second player is going to get a second
guy so let's choose our second dice this
one is perfect to this particular this
run so we're going to place that number
3 value there that way the players
starting out to get those threes and
fours and the objectives up there and
you know some good placement back to
player 1 let's see we got not much to
choose from we can't really grab any
yeah we yeah we can't grab the red dice
unfortunately because we can't place
them next to each other here or here and
unfortunately due to the rule here we
can't place our red dice there to start
on our diagonals so we're gonna have to
go that guy's can't go there because
that needs a 1 can't go there because
that needs a green so we are going to
plunk it right down there so as you oh
yeah anyway end of the round now that
both players placed two dice we take the
remaining dice and we chuck it down on
the round tracker there that helps us
keep track of how many rounds were
played in the game and I just think
that's kind of neat anyway players will
continue running die so let's go for our
second round five more dice from the bag
roll them player two will draw this time
let's see how we go so we've got a two
here and the player could you know
that's a green spot there but because of
this global rule here we're going to
shade shade variety
we've already got a two floating down
here so that is not the best placement
to go for here let's see what else we
got we could too yeah so we might go to
that diagonal Chuck that one in over
here shooting up the diagonals hoping it
to get a yellow five later on the game
back to player 1 what do we got not too
much not much still let's grab that to
pop it there grow a new one so we need a
four let's check that one there back to
play out two and roe on so this this
continues the game is actually pretty
quick at the beginning when you've got
heaps of placement options not so many
rules to keep in mind but as your board
fills up life gets hard because you're
going to be rolling stuff that might
potentially not fit anywhere on your
board in which case you're not going to
get a full window come the end of the
game for every dice space that is not
filled in at the end of the game you
lose one point so players are going to
want to place well play smart and
hopefully match up as cut as many of
these global rules global objectives as
possible while still keeping in mind
they are their personal objective oh so
that's how you played again is a lot to
think about a lot of a lot of placement
options and yeah it just becomes a bit
of a brain melter towards the end let's
just have a quick look at what this game
might have looked like at the end of the
round
alright let's go ahead and show off one
of these tools up here so each one of
these tools and they're randomly
selected from a small deck these guys
let's see if I can just get them out to
show you so here are this is the deck
here so as you can save plenty of
different rules that you can use to
break the game to help you make you a
window but these are the three that
we've been dealt out today I'm just
going to give you an example of how to
use them so we've got this one over here
this is a running pliers says after your
first turn immediately drafted ice and
then skip your next turn this around
what this means is I'm allowed to place
my dice like here and then place this
favor taken over here to immediately
take my second pick now it's always a
good idea to save these for really
awesome roles that come out but just to
show you what it's all like I'm going to
use it to take this three pop it here
it's not breaking any rules and it's not
going to you know you have a short
coming later on so let's go with that
onward with the game
alright so now this here would be a much
better opportunity to use this power so
let's go ahead Chuck that five up there
as part of my standard draft use that
favor token for player 2 and we will pop
this one down here so this is really
leading me up for another diagonal
placement pretty nice to ask me let's
continue on here we go for another tool
use we're going to use the glazing
hammer up here which allows you to
reroll all the dice in the draft pool
and it can only be used on your second
turn before drafting so that's this
current turn I'm going to play that now
we grab the dice now the reason I'm
doing this is because I want I want a
five and it's it's not going to work I
want a one there we go so I want a one
in there and you know this is probably
the best opportunity for me to roll I
think I'll have a one in six chance
times too so hopefully let's work this
out nap crap roll all right now we just
roll with it so here we've got a perfect
opportunity to use the glazing hammer
for player 2 right now we've got two
blue dice that can't really go anywhere
we can't put in this green spot over
here we can't put it in this four spot
because there are no 4 is there up here
we can't place it because there's a blue
next to it hell we can't even play
severe if we tried the only placement
location for these dice is over here and
I can't have a two or a three and you
know what that's what I rolled so let's
play this grab one of our favorite
tokens chuck it down and go to the
reroll yes we did it guys so let's go
Chuck that five in this blue spot here
and we're still in the game
[Music]
all right here we have the final role
for the ground and we've got some
problems going on so let's check it out
player 2 is going up first and the only
two spots we've got left I here and here
one of them has to be a green dice so
here is our only rolled green dice and
it can't be placed because of that for
their that is such a shame so it looks
like player 2 is just not going to be
able to finish it there window the best
I think we can do for them is grab this
no we can't even put that one down to
make that diagonal let's keep looking
we've got the fire alright so player 2
is going to grab it this five chuck it
in this spot up here is just to gain a
little bit more for the diagonal but
that's about the most they can hope for
over to player 1 and we've got yeah
we've got some issues so they'll start
off by playing the safe bet here
grabbing this yellow number one popping
it there that is a perfect role for them
because it allows them to keep the
diagonal as well as taking a very
difficult placement spot now we've got
to our oh man so player 1 is basically
going to have to take this 3 pop it in
there even though it completely ruins
their column shade variety they might
make up for it in points for the three
for medium shade bonus as well so that's
pretty much game there goes back to
player 2 they've got no more favor
tokens to reroll they can't take the
dice so we just grab one of them chuck
it in that tent marker and it's done so
let's look at how we score this one we
flip our round marker over to reveal
this beautifully colored a point token
that track up we will also grab our
point tokens here we flip them over to
the non 50 side just because we're
probably not going to be getting 50
points in this way
so first off we do the public objectives
which are these ones here let's start
with our threes and fours so we're
looking for pairs of threes and fours so
the easiest way to do this one is to go
through and count the number of fours
and three so we've got one for two for
three fours nice so we can get a total
of three pairs here let's have a look at
our threes one two and three beautiful
so we've gotten three pairs of medium
shades to display here gaining us six
points so let's pop that marker down
there on the six and we'll go over to
player 2 beautiful so we've got our
three chairs there as well so they are
equal on 6 that is our first public
objective it done let's have a look at
that column shade variety play one over
here for 615 perfect 1523 perfect five
are stuffed it here we've got 25 so
we're not going to get the cone shade
variety there but let's move on three is
we're not going to get them here either
but that last one we will so we're going
to get three columns at four points each
which is 12 more points for a play here
bring us to 18 a nice jump let's go to
player 2 on 2 22 points that is a very
nice the player too let's check out our
diagonals it so basically here we're
just counting at diagonal dice and play
one that did appallingly except this
little yellow picky or something like
that so again 11 points there hopefully
I've added that up right so we are going
up to 29 points very nice let's go to
play a to now
so 12 points for player 2 they're
bringing them up to 34 still in the lead
all right so that's all the public
objectives that done that let's go for
the private objectives I'm pretty sure
we both did shockingly they're mainly
because I forgot about this one for this
player here oh let's go for player one
first so we pretty much add up the value
of chits on each die so red has
completely smashed it here with 11 12 13
and 14 not bad at all so let's go to the
43 points there and blue I'm at our
player to hear I am so sorry i only get
four points 23 or shocking oh so it pays
to take attention to those ones that's
for sure all right now we count up how
many unspent favor tokens we've got um
not so many there guys but no players
have got any favor tokens because yeah
let's just go on to spend each year and
finally each player will lose one
victory point for each space not covered
so our player 2 goes back a notch and
that is game so red smashed it sorry
read it did better than blue certainly
did not smash it that was a horribly
played game by me but pretty quick too
so that is let's just have a nice closer
look at these ones because they are just
pretty as guys there it is that's how
you play so let's have a bit of a chat
about it let's still pros and cons thing
I like that cons sagrada is a very lucky
game in fact the entire play can be made
or broke your window could be made or
broken on a single roll of dice even
with it really good planning I don't
think there's a way to mitigate all of
that so it can't be a purely strategic
game now the tools they certainly help
to mitigate those like factors but they
don't always work out you
or in the example game there I could
talk about scene being a negative but
this the thin really okay this is where
we're shifting into the good stuff such
a theme really does accommodate what
could have been a bland abstract game
that still would have been an awesome
game for the the thinker's out there but
as soon as you put on a beautiful theme
like Duke stained-glass windows you
attract the attention of so many more
people that would just normally dismiss
an abstract like this so art production
all that stuff that this game looks
beautiful on the table if you've got
more than a couple of people going on
it's just the color spreads and spreads
and it's fantastic now as far as target
audience goes I reckon this game hits
everybody it is suitable for beginners
all the way up to those high sinkers out
there that need that strategic punch in
the face because this game gets there
you can sit down with the beginner
explain the rules be ready to go in a
couple of minutes no worries you might
come to a little bit of trouble towards
the end but that's just the fun of
learning a new system like this one
simple to play impossible for master
this is one of those perfect
combinations so if you've not got
anything like this in the collection
grab it so that's about it guys this is
a fantastic combination of luck strategy
and beautiful theme are all rolled into
one for me if there's nothing quite like
it around and it is one of those rare
games that can sneak in as a filler and
end up being just one of the mind
melters of the evening so if you've got
any questions chuck them down in the
comments below and i'll get back to you
if you want to see anything up close I
think you pretty much saw everything to
do with that game anyway so um we are
about done thank you very much for
watching guys as always my name is
Michael this is bits aboard we'll catch
you next time

welcome back to man versus meeple the
show we talk about all things board game
related today we're talking about a
brand new game called sagrada by
floodgate games it is a wonderful player
30-minute experience that plays ages 13
and up yeah 13 and up I'd say maybe even
a little lower this is a great
accessible game and a great introductory
to dice drafting for sure yeah so the
game is based around the Sagrada família
which is a very beautiful Church in
Spain that's known for its architecture
and stained glass and it's stained glass
windows of course so in this game
players are gonna be building their own
stained glass window with coloured dice
five different colored dice which we'll
be placing in their window and unique
patterns to score points right
everyone's gonna be scoring points in
similar fashions yet everyone does also
have a secret objective to score points
as well plus there are some placement
rules that have the game a very
satisfying puzzle every turn that's
right so let's walk you through the
components real quick at the start of
the game each player will be dealt one
private objective there are five private
objectives in the game and they're all
for placing particular colored dice in
their window frame right
each of these give you points depending
upon the number of pips that you have of
that color at the end of the game then
players will be dealt window frames
they'll actually get two different
window frames which are double-sided
once they know the color of their
objective they can pick these they're
gonna pick one of these window frames
and then pick one side of them to use
now there's two important features on
these window frames one is the colors
and the numbers when you're placing dice
through the future of the game you'll
have to place light-colored dice on
those locations and then pips of those
numbers and those can be any color right
you're going to place that actually into
your frame and it slides right into the
bottom of your window frame also on the
bottom of each of these window frames
you have favor tokens and these favor
tokens are these crystals here that
allow you to manipulate the dice through
two cards in the game exactly and that's
gonna vary depending on what card you
take and that's also related to sort of
the difficulty of that card because as I
said earlier there are placement rules
that make this a little tricky it's not
as simple as picking a card randomly
yeah because you
you can't place like numbers next to
each other or like colors next to each
other you also have some public
objectives in addition to the three
tools that you always have you'll have
three public objectives and these are
asking players to do sets of numbers or
particular patterns or diagonals on the
board that will give you victory points
at the end of the game depending upon
those patterns and the number that's
associated with them right you have a
round track which also on the backside
is a score track once the game is done
you're gonna be playing through 10
rounds in the game and then of course
you have your colored dye and there is
90 dice that are placed into the bag and
they're randomly brought out by the
first player depending upon the number
of players and rolled at the start of
every round and then draft it that's the
that's the main meaty portion of the
game yeah so you're gonna be playing
over ten rounds starting with the first
player that player is going to pull an x
number of dice from the bag depending
upon the number of players we have a
four player game so we have nine dice
that were drafted they're going to roll
those dice at the start and then a draft
starts in a snake fashion so starting
with the first player they're gonna pick
one of those dice and then around the
table and then snake back around to that
first player again now as David alluded
to there's some placement rules in this
game that you have to know the very
first die that you have to place in the
very beginning of the game has to be
around the edge of the board around the
corners again you have to follow the
rules of the game color dice have to be
placed in those particular colors on
your window frame and dice that have PIP
numbers on them have to be placed on
those specific fed members on your board
yeah now there's some other rules here
that are very important to make sure
that you follow because the game gets
progressively harder as you go
absolutely yourself in a jam for sure
you can one you can never place two dice
next to each other that have the same
pip number and that is orthogonal E so
you can't have a six next to a six or a
five next to a five also you cannot have
the same colored dice next to each other
or phenomenally so you can have a yellow
next to a yellow anytime you place a die
you're lost to place anywhere adjacent
to any die that you currently have on
the board right including the including
diagonal yes yeah the the dice placement
gets a little interesting because the
other thing you have to remember the
colors are easy easy to see
on these stained-glass windows but the
pip numbered spaces if there's a five
and you happen to use a five in one of
the white spaces and I don't think we
said the white spaces you can place any
die yeah but if you were to place say a
four next to that four you've just
blocked yourself on yourself so unless
there's a card that allows you to move
some dice around and there are some
things like that potentially in the game
you've basically blocked yourself out of
fulfilling that one space once it snakes
back around to the first player the last
die that's available and always be one
die available that goes on to the round
track signifying that that round is now
done now one thing you can do at any
time during your turn is you can also
ask for a favor from the church and
that's by using a tool there's always
three tools that are available to all
the players and you'll be using your
favorite tokens
again those favorite tokens are granted
once and once only at the start of the
game depending upon how difficult your
window is you can place one of these
favor tokens on any one of these three
cards to enact that ability and that
allows you to manipulate the dice in
particular ways put dice back in the bag
reroll dice and so forth but again these
things they're not the same three every
games now can't always rely on that same
tool that you use the last game to be
able to manipulate your dice now the
trick in these favor cards is that once
one player places a favour on them as
such every player then out for the rest
of the game has to place two on there so
it becomes progressively harder to use
the favors if you don't go to them early
but you don't typically want to go to
them early because as the game
progresses it gets harder and harder to
place the die that you need to place in
order to meet your private objective as
well as the public objectives and these
let you like manipulate those dice a
little better so going some later in the
game is way more beneficial than early
game one plus those are unused ones are
points of the game so yeah like Jeremy
said you want to hold on to those things
of course unless you make a bonehead
move like I have done in the beginning
of a game and really need to make some
adjustments before it gets too costly
out there once a round is over play just
moves to the next player in clockwise
fashion they start as a first player and
it progresses over ten rounds once ten
rounds is done you start adding up the
points not here's other points work
every favor token that a player has is
worth one victory
at the end of the game every windowpane
that is not covered by die loses that
player one victory points public
objective court cards will score out
depending upon if players meet those
objectives for instance one of the ones
we have here on the Left says that if a
column has four different colored dice
in that location they will score five
victory points for each column that they
have right and the last one is their
private objective for instance I have
the purple private objective so for
every purple die that I have the pit
count is how many points I will score so
if I'm placing a lot of sixes on the
board that are purple they can give me a
lot of victory points at the end of it
yeah this is an interesting part of the
game because you're wanting to
definitely keep track of what other
players are doing and if I see Jeremy
picking up every high value purple die
throughout the game I might get a sense
that he has the purple objective card
that also kind of plays into some of
these public objective cards because
right now we have a card that you gives
you points two points for every pair of
a1 and a2 so obviously that's going to
sort of contradict taking high value
pips Pip dice so let's get into the
review yeah absolutely
I I really like a lot of things about
the game the art style obviously is
gonna draw people in right away oh it's
a beautiful beautiful large game
beautiful box the dice are very colored
these components are amazing yeah having
the recessed boards and having the dice
fit in those locations and having the
slide in there to give the players the
variability at the start right is really
really good I like the tools I like any
kind of game that allows you to
manipulate your dice I hate dice that
once you roll them it is what it is and
this game has a lot of those options but
it doesn't have too many so you are very
very beholden by how many favorite
tokens you have so you have to use them
strategically throughout the course of
the game but the game plays really fast
you're playing this in 30 minutes so it
doesn't outlast it's welcomed by any
means no absolutely not and I think also
even even without the tools just the
fact that it is a dice drafting game
helps lower the impact of the negative
impact of look yeah you know because
you're drafting your dice so if you're
not if you don't see exactly what you
want on any given turn you can kind of
look around your board and find a spot
for some of the dice that are out there
generally except when it comes down to
the end of the game some
and you just need that green for you
can't roll it the other thing I really
like about this game is how the game
gradually ramps up
I love the puzzle aspect of trying to
both meet your private objective but
also trying to fulfill these public
objectives while you're trying to manage
this board that is locking you down you
have to be very very thoughtful by the
way you place your diet because you can
lock yourself out of positions by
placing as David said very early in the
video that if you place a number in the
wrong location that locks you out of a
color that you need to go to you're in
trouble right and you're gonna have to
use your tools at that point the only
thing that I don't like about the game
and this may just be me is that I feel
like after you've played this game I
don't know four or five times you will
have seen everything that you possibly
can see there's only 12 tools there's
five public objectives all our private
objectives all the private objectives
are four colors so there's no variance
and that other than trying to meet a
very specific color and then there are
ten public objectives I feel like with
one media expansion that allows for more
variety and your private objectives it
could be a very good game I would agree
with the fact that it's right for
expansion yes like you could just
continually come out with more
windowpane guards more tools all sorts
of different things
I still think though at the end of the
day the game while some of those
variable elements can you can get
through in a few games pretty easily the
game itself because you're drafting dice
because you're rolling dice that's gonna
be different every time because you can
take so many different things during any
given game it definitely has a lot of
replayability in my opinion plus I think
one of the greatest things about this
game is its extraordinaire aliy except
accessible yeah this is a great gateway
game it's beautiful to look at anyone
could play this I think so too I mean I
think I think an eight-year-old who can
obviously read it could play this game
they're gonna screw up but that's part
of the fun of solving these puzzles is
placing dice and learning from that and
I think this doesn't punish you too much
for doing that yeah um a great
opportunity to teach kids you know some
of the new the nuances of a game like
this particularly with these tools and
how you can use things to manipulate you
know mistakes you've made
yeah beautiful looking game guys this is

hi Mike policia from solo mode games
here today I'm going to do a solo
session of the game sagrada this is from
floodgate games and designers darrell
andrews and adrian adam sq sagrada is a
dice drafting and placement game where
you are trying to create the most
spectacular stained-glass window that
you can you do this by choosing color
dice rolling them drafting them
following some placement rules utilizing
some card tools that allow you to
manipulate and mitigate some of the dice
rolls to try to create the most
spectacular stained-glass window that
you can this is a game that is very
quick to learn it's easy to teach it
plays very quickly especially in the
solitaire mode you can be done in 20
minutes in most cases and I think you'll
get a pretty good idea of how the game
plays here in just a moment so let's go
to the table and take a look okay here
we have the solo set up for sagrada game
where we are trying to create the most
spectacular stained-glass window the
setup is very simple we have a round
marker here a round tracker that goes
from 1 to 10 we've got 5 tools that I'll
explain in a moment we've got 2 what are
called public objectives and 1 what is
called a private objective in the
multiplayer game that private objective
would be kept
obviously private it would be kept in
your hand but there's no reason to have
it private in the solo game it just
stays face-up like the public objective
to do and then we've got our frame where
we're going to have our dice placement
and our actual player board which is
going to slip into that frame in a
moment I want to explain something
really quickly beforehand this is the
player board this is where we're
actually going to be placing the dice
once they are drafted it has a name
which is really just there for flavor
and then you see a number of dots here
in the number of dots corresponds to the
difficulty
lower number of dots the easier it is to
place your dice now the solo game is
quite difficult I have not won yet and
so I went with the lowest difficulty in
the multiplayer game those dots not only
correspond to difficulty they correspond
to the number of what you'd call favor
tokens that you would get favor tokens
in the multiplayer game are used to
purchase activate use of those tools in
the multiplayer game rzb in the solo
game there are no favor tokens so you
purchase those through drafting dice and
I'll explain that in a moment so let me
go ahead and place this in the frame and
then I'll explain how the basic round
structure goes okay we're going to have
ten rounds as I mentioned each round I'm
going to draw randomly from the bag
four dice two of those dice are going to
be hopefully placed in my window the
other two are going to go one of two
places they're either going to go onto
one of these tool cards to pay for its
ability or they're going to go up here
on the round marker at the end of the
game the score that I'm trying to beat
is going to be the total number of pips
on the dice here so really generally
speaking you want to put low value dice
up here because you don't want it to add
up to a whole life Alecto a whole lot
and you also want to use all five of the
tools if you can not only do they
usually help you manipulate the dice and
mitigate some bad rolls but they also
are dice that don't get added towards
the total that you have to beat alright
so let me quickly explain the placement
rules because then the tools will make a
bit more sense here you can see a couple
of different things you see colored
squares and you see numbered squares all
right the colored squares simply mean
that any dice you place there have to be
of that color so these have to be red
that could be any value these have to be
yellow purple and blue these are called
shade restrictions and these
our number so you have to have a four
there but it could be of any color to 6
and 1 respectively ok
the first dice that you are seeing the
first die you place has to be along an
outer edge then the other placement
rules is that dice has to be placed
adjacent to each other so for example if
I placed my first die here
the next die I place has to be in one of
these five spots it can be diagonal as
well as orthogonal ok the other
restrictions in placing dice are that
you cannot have two of the same colors
next to each other and you can't have
two of the same numbers next to each
other and that is only orthogonal so for
example I would not want to place a red
to here because if I place a red to here
although it fits the shade restriction I
could not place a die here because you
can't have two Reds next to each other I
also wouldn't be able to put a two here
here or here of any color ok so those
are some basic restrictions that apply
you don't have to worry about it
diagonally but orthogonal E that's
something you have to keep in mind
so let's look really quickly at the five
tools that I have you've got the flux
remover to be able to utilize this tool
I would have to place any purple dye and
what this would allow me to do is after
drafting I could return dieted of dice
bag pull another dye from the bag choose
a value of any that I like and place
that obeying all the placement
restrictions I mentioned okay I've got
the cork back straight edge which any
yellow dice in yellow dye can trigger
after drafting I place a dye in a spot
that's not adjacent to another dye so as
I mentioned you before the regular rules
is that every dice every diverse place
has to be adjacent to another this
allows you to break that rule all right
the copper foil burnisher any color
three will allow me access to this which
will allow me to move any one down it's
all
in my window ignoring shade restriction
so as you see here you can move a three
into what would normally only be
available to a one
I have a late skin which is triggered by
any color for where you move exactly two
dice that are already in your window
somewhere else in your window however
they do have to obey placement
restrictions you don't break any rules
there and then finally I've got the
glazing hammer which can be triggered
with any blue dye that allows you to
re-roll all dice in the draft pool but
it can only be used on your second turn
before drafting so it's after you've
placed your first dye in the window you
could trigger this glazing hammer with a
blue dye re-roll the last two and place
those my objectives column color variety
for any columns with no repeated colors
I'll get five points at the end of the
game so potentially I could have 25
points if all five of my columns have no
repeating colors I don't think that's
likely but that's the potential there
then I've got color variety which the
sets of all five colors however many of
those I have I get four points each so
these are the five colors that are
represented on the dice however many of
those sets I get will be 40 so if I had
two complete sets of the font colors I
get eight points for example at the end
of the game and then shades of green
this would be normally my private
objective what this means is that for
every green dye that I place in my
window at the end of the game I'm going
to add up all the number of pips on
those dice and add it to my score so
that's where my scoring comes from my
scoring comes from these cards and I
have to also keep in mind that any open
die spots on my window are going to
count to a negative three in a
multiplayer game you only lose one point
per open spot in the solo game any open
spot is a minus three so you really want
to try to fill this up completely if you
can so you add up the points you gain
from your objective cards you subtract
any open spots and you're going to
pair that to the number of dice here on
the round tracker and that's going to be
your win or loss condition so let's go
ahead and go with the first round I'm
going to pull four dice randomly out of
the bag there we go
all right well unfortunately I got a
very low green which I'm not thrilled
about because I'd like a higher one so
that I can place it on my window and get
some points so what I could do I could
think about using my glazing hammer with
this blue re rolling that green to try
to get and then I can also reroll the
six because potentially if I'm not
placing that it would be going up there
so I think that's what I'm going to
think about doing I'm going to put this
on an outer edge I know I'm going to
want to place a green next so I'll place
it know I can't place here because I
don't want to cover that I don't block
that out let's place it here okay I can
put the green here or here I will put
the two on the glazing hammer all right
re roll these I want a low number red
and a high number green and I want the
exact opposite of what I just saw and
now the red didn't work out for me so I
had a decision to make here do I want to
go ahead and place the red potentially
maybe here and to just put the three up
there that's probably what I'm going to
do because I don't want those six points
working against me so I gave it a shot
it didn't work out I'll place the red
there because it's adjacent to that
first die and I'll put the green up here
all right round two
there we go four guys all right well I'd
like to place the purple because it's a
high-value wouldn't mind getting this
green out there because that would be
three points for me let's go ahead and
place this five here all right
i jus seen Jason see rules are fine
there I will place a three here because
I know
oops that is a three I can't have to put
a two or a four there and that's going
to give five points to my opponents all
right all right let's see here well I'd
like to place both of these so that I
can put the one in the two up there so
why don't I place this three here oops
that is a three I keep moving these
that's a three I could place this three
I don't want to put it here because I
don't want to block myself there I can
place it here and then I'll place the
two and the one up here so I'm keeping
low numbers up there as much as I can
all right you can see how quickly turns
go all right well I don't want to put
that six up there so I'd like to place
the four and the six and put the one in
the two up there and I think I can do
that like so if I put the four here and
if I put the six here I'm still okay I
don't have any repeat colors in my
columns yet so that's kind of nice -
I'll put the two in the one right up
there
for more I which are getting a few more
greens but that's the brakes okay so
I've got two ones a five and a four I
obviously want to play my higher numbers
if possible I can play my four here if
it's that shade restriction and I can
place the five here or here but I don't
want to put it here since I already have
a purple there the other thing I could
do is place the five here and that would
give me four different color dice to
give me that five points there so that's
what I'm going to do place the five
there I don't believe I'm broken any
rules here that two points goes up there
all right we're going to happen to pull
two greens here so it would be lovely to
get both of those especially if they're
high values now I got a five and a three
that's not bad but I do have a six that
I have to deal with okay so that's five
I'd love to place there but I can't I
can't play it here though so I'll put
the five here I think I'm going to go
ahead and place the red six here keep it
off of the opponent's board still
keeping different colors all right put
those six points up they're not ideal
but you know and I haven't been using my
tool that may come back to bite me here
at the end of the game we'll find out I
also need to get some more yellow out
here so that I can get the color variety
bonus all right well I did pull two
yellows all right a three and a one okay
low numbers that's actually I'm okay
with that let's put this yellow three
here
hmm don't want to put that there let me
take a moment can't put the blue three
here all right well yeah I could do this
okay put the yellow three here right
that's that's okay
making sure myself I'm not messing up I
can put this one it's yellow one here
all right
I'm giving up five points but I'm really
hoping that I'm going to be able to get
I'm doing really well with these column
color varieties yet I will see no see
okay
okay some high numbers here so now we
need to think about okay
unfortunately okay well I can put this
green five here that still keeps my
colors alive and it gets a high number
play no I cannot put that green five
there there's a green three right there
not so fast maybe start looking at let's
start looking at so I can place yeah I
think that's what I'm going to do I'm
going to place a group red three here to
use the copper foil burnisher which
allows me oh I'll do that told me I can
move well and really what I want to do I
can place my green three here but I lose
my bonus they're my color bonus I can
place a green five here that may be the
way to go for my first one because that
still keeps this alive doesn't break any
rules I can place my red four here or I
can place a green three here I think I'm
going to do that place the green three
here I won't get the color bonus on this
column
I think I'm okay otherwise play those
seven points up there pull three purples
oops can I drop one okay go scaring away
let me all right well let's see what I
got here purple two can go right there
it's going to lose that color bonus
purple two could also go here but then
I'm closing myself out there and it
would also lose me that bonus there the
red six can go here which would give me
that five points and keep it off of
there so it seems like sure play would
be to put the red six here okay no I
cannot there's a three red three right
there you know you think that would be
obvious you don't I don't always see it
right away sometimes it takes me some
real it really has to be very deliberate
about where i'm bulletyme placing where
i can put the two here I could put the
two there I'd lose my color bonus could
also be looking okay so let's do this
let's use the flux remover after
drafting or turn the dye to the dice bag
and pull once in the back so let's get
this red six out of here put it in the
bag pull a new one
I'd love a green dye because then I
would just place it at the six and put
it right there
hey what do you know I got a green dye I
promise you that that was legit I did
not look so that green dye goes right
there okay and then do I go and just
place that purple to there or I place
the purple to here and get those five
points yeah I think that's why I've got
to do place the purple to there put the
purple three there one more round
all right okay so I Wow
I lucked out because I got a yellow to
here that I can place right there which
is wonderful
oops that was a - you saw it camera
doesn't lie
alright so that yellow - I'm okay here
yes alright now here the red six works
and I get that bonus color there too so
that's pretty fantastic no it does not
work Mike you keep trying - you keep
trying to ignore that red three the
green would work no would not because
you got a green side there so I've got
to find a way maybe there's something I
can do here to play something else
alright can't place a four can't place a
three I can place a yellow that doesn't
help me does not help me that's gonna
hurt because I'm gonna have to place all
of these no I could put the yellow Arden
with the red six right there no I can't
I can't keep trying to put I keep trying
to put a red dice there I died there all
right well that that last one man may
have killed me because let's
double-check can't place that there
because there's yellows can't place this
year because there's a five can't place
this because there's a red three can't
put the yellow here because there's no
way to play something that's not
adjacent to another dye don't have a
three don't have a four so all of these
that's 16
but I just lost right there that that's
going to hurt so let's let's find out
where we're at okay let's find out where
we're at so we're at 8 10 11 14 16 19 22
27 37 47 create for nearly 50 you're
they do 53 points so I've got a beat 53
probably not likely but let's see here
I'll put this on 53 just to remind you
what they got
alright so my points how many column
colors that I get watch let's do this
let's put that 53 right there all right
my points I get one column here of
different variety one column here of
different variety one column here so
that's 15 points all right then green I
get 16 17 18 19 20 - 25 25 and 15 is 40
all right now color variety let's see
what my sets are here I've got green red
blue yellow purple looks like it's going
to be 2 if I'm lucky because I only had
2 blues they're green red blue yellow
and purple so that's going to give me 8
more points so 48 so hey that's that is
actually much closer than I've ever come
before 48 to 53 I feel okay about that
especially since if not for that really
rough last term where I had to give them
16 points I really think I had a chance
there oh you know what nope
I had a missing I did have a missing
spot on my window so let me take three
points off so 45 but still I can live
with 45 that's not too bad as far as I
go now
I potentially you can do better but for
me I feel pretty good with that so
hopefully you got an idea of how the
game is played it's quick it's really
fast turns and easy to setup and
teardown
so sagrada looks like something you
might be interested in you might want to
give this a shot thank you so much have
a great day
you

in sagata you will be building a
beautiful stained glass window with
different colored dice each round you'll
be drafting Dice and a serpentine style
and placing it in your window adjacent
to a die and following color or number
restrictions each game will have a
different set of public goals like
trying to have one of each of the
different colors in a row or having sets
of one or two and so on but you'll also
get a private goal like adding up all
the Pips of a certain color that's on
your board each game there's also
different ways to break rules of the
game and you can activate these by
spending some currency if someone's
already there you got to spend a little
more and it's not as easy as it looks
cuz you cannot place a die of the same
color orthly adjacent to one another or
the same number and after 10 Rounds
scoring is almost entirely made of your
private and the public goals and the
game has a lot of replayability because
there's 24 different card sides that you
can place in here with different amounts
of
[Music]
difficulty hello my friends it's the
Game Boy geek here wow sagata is an
excellent puzzly dice drafting game it's
got simple rules but lots of depth tons
of replayability the puzzle changes
every time your goals change every time
you got the private goals and the public
goals and those are different and then
you got the tools that allow you to
break the rules of the game and those
change every game as well and the easier
board you have the less times you get to
break the rules and vice versa so I love
how it is balanced this is an excellent
excellent excellent Family Style game
puzzly great thing to think about
changes your bra made my brain smoke but
I love it um it the solo game is very
good on the con side analysis paralysis
can become an issue if you have a group
that's prone to that as you're trying to
figure out which dice to draft and the
dice are rounded and small so they flip
a lot when you try to pick them up and
put them down wish they were Square dice
but two minor nit picks the game is
amazing I kept it in my gaming Library
it got a saxophone serenade this video

sup nerds I'm Wes and I'm Erin today
we're taking a look at subrata the most
beautiful game I've ever seen by
floodgate games in sagrada you are
building a beautiful stained-glass
window which is represented by this
player board that you have and you
actually select the window you want to
work on and gonna be drafting dice
throughout the game to actually assemble
this window the one thing the sagrada
has that really kind of stands apart for
me is how you draft the dice the
beginning of each turn and drafting is
not my favorite mechanic i'm not opposed
to it I don't hate games a draft I don't
like really heavy drafting games that's
like the main thing you do like I like
drafting in seasons I like that's good I
like drafting in sagrada you know
pulsars okay you know just it's okay it
is partly just because the drafting goes
by so quick you know it's only a color
and a number you're picking from and so
there's not a huge amount of analysis
paralysis you know when you're drafting
out of like a head of eight cards it's
like read each card and like you know
sit there and figure out these cards are
and think about like okay what do I want
and what do I want to hate draft away
from them
you know like it's it's so simple and
clean that it happens really quick and
it actually is it's not just like okay
with the drafting but I really enjoy the
drafting in this game and since all of
the dice are they're visible to everyone
during the draft everyone can be
thinking about the dice they want
immediately know when you're talking
about a card drafting you have to read
your entire hand and then pass it now
you've got a new hand of cards you need
to read like a bunny kingdom you're
looking at these cards if you get
parchments and things you gotta like to
really think about and even you're
looking at like oh I've had this hand
before what's missing from it I wonder
like okay it's missus missing so one of
them took this card so I don't want to
leave that like yeah there's there's a
lot of strategy and card games like that
or this you can look out there like hmm
I really want that too but help me and I
can see his I can see your window over
there your you might take that too
please don't take that too I really need
it and then you take it like I knew he
was gonna take it okay let me take this
too
six I guess yeah it's kind of an
abstract game I would say and the fact
that you know you're you have this board
that the mechanics they do work but it
almost has nothing really to do with the
theme yeah the theme was there I think
the artwork is part of what really sells
this game but you're definitely like
yeah I just
I could definitely felt like you know
all those times I built the stained
glass window this is exactly what that
felt like I definitely don't want to say
it's a negative because again the
aesthetics and the look and feel of the
game is part of what sold me on it
because the dice drafting in place back
it's cool but it really is a game that
like it's impressive to have on your
shelf just because beautiful I remember
looking at the Kickstarter that was the
biggest thing as a man that like the
artwork is so cool
the way this game is built around these
objectives if you're all trying to
finish that really you know make
difficult decisions like there will be
dice out there and you're trying to
either just like the color or the number
on them and make them match up with your
selected sheet and then you're also you
know trying to make sure you don't block
yourself out of other options later by
putting you know if there's a one year
you can't put a one next to it so you're
not gonna want to block yourself and if
you're trying to pull off a combo or
getting all colors at all the way across
one row there's a lot of thought and
like okay if I get this number here and
it's green that I can't get a green one
up here of that cup number this isn't
gonna work and there's it can be a
little bit of analysis paralysis
towards the end of the game or more like
in my game like every few turns equates
top I'm gonna have to mulligan this
because I place this dice illegally so
I'm going to move it up but then if I
plays that one illegally well we
probably started skiing over I do think
that the whole objectives and placing it
kinda right be a little bit of a zoo how
there's not like one thing we're going
for but there's multiple things you go
for it to get like there's different
ways to get points we're here like Oh
way you get points or how you place them
in you get bonus points for this and
then even the fact that we're not having
like symmetric player boards that is
beginning when you pick which like which
template you want to put into your
stained glass makes it really did
and it's not just like oh you got a
superior template you're gonna have an
easier time by the fact there's a
difficulty levels on them that give you
more if the little gems that you buy
tools later on I think that was a really
cool mechanic because you can go and say
okay well I just want to get a lot of
these gems get a lot of tools or just
bonus points the end of the game but
it's gonna be a lot harder for me to
pick like where I'm placing them or I
want to have a really easy one where it
may not get as many bonus points there's
many tools but hopefully I won't need
them because of how easy it is to build
this window
I definitely think they put a lot of
thought into the design of those
different difficulties when you've
picked the more difficult ones it is
really hard because you're like okay I
can only put purple in this row and now
I can't put any really high-value
purples in this row because you know
there's fives and sixes next to it then
you go to one of the ones it's a level
three and there's a lot of blanks on it
so you can easily fill your window in
and not worry about blocking yourself I
do definitely think that bounds is a big
thing in here and honestly just the
whole game is so fluid that there rules
it's almost like you can further rules
like that it's not like Oh what happens
here like let's check the rules it
doesn't make sense because of how fluid
the game works and how well-designed it
is so yeah I agree
great job on this one so you brought up
the tools the first thing you're trying
to get is these objectives the tools
really do help you achieve them some of
them are really good early game some of
them you definitely want to wait till
the end but after somebody else has
already use that tool that cost of now
increases from one favorite open to two
and you're trading up to victory points
if you save those for potentially one or
two victory points you know by placing
it in your window like if you're only
using your tool to keep a base you know
the last spot on your window from you
going blank and getting that negative
victory point for that it's not worth it
but if by placing that you're you know
completing an objective as well then it
might be worth it because you're
swinging you know two points four six or
something yeah that was definitely
something that I struggled with starting
off in this game is I just wanted that
oh look I can buy this tool do this and
this tool will do this and aha look how
much better
doing the new are and in the end of the
game came along and Aaron still had a
lot of those favorite tokens left and
like those extra points they may not
seem like much but this is a game where
those few extra bonus points really make
a big difference it's always been a very
close game the main group is always
within like 10 points of each other
there may be somebody they lagged behind
but very rarely is that we're one guys
like 20 or 30 points ahead the last
thing I want to touch on is the
production quality of this game I think
it is like out of the ballpark
excellent these player boards being like
double sheets are super great and the
fact that you know these the tiles you
select that window you selected fits
right on in they it comes with a dice
bag which is a nice thick dice bag it's
I'm one of those cheap ones it's gonna
fall apart and the dice I mean I guess
the bags are okay but they're clear
there's lots of them the component
quality almost goes along the aesthetics
because it's not just like oh these
carbs have pretty artwork but the way
all the components fit together to build
your windows is part of what makes this
game really pop I really think Sagrada
is one of those games that is gonna hit
the table a lot for a lot of people and
definitely in my friend and family group
it's really easy to teach but you do
build on strategy over time and you can
start to like really metagame it with
the gaming group you're playing with you
can kind of figure out like ooh he's
picking up these certain dice colors at
fives and sixes that must be his color
I'm gonna start heat drafting those dice
because I can use them in my windows
just as easily that may change with the
expansion that's coming out down the
road that's coming out with new player
unique cards that you're you know see
your objective secret objectives and and
new objectives for out there as well
plus more players so that always makes
everything win I played this game a lot
I actually played it in an extra life
tournament so playing this in a
tournament it kind of sheds a new light
on you're like wow I didn't even think
about a game like this being that
competitive that you could compete and
it and it definitely holds up it's fun
to just see like how people go into a
game that is designed to be almost
family way
but make it really competitive and put
money on the line sagrada is definitely
one of those games that i spend a lot of
time like looking at the kickstarter and
being like back in back back I really
want to back it I want to back this game
instead and I ended up passing over it
which I kind of regret and so when I got
a chance to pick it up actually an
already had a copy new text music hey
time to copy here coming definitely buy
it and hopefully that's alleviated I
know that they had a second wave of
reprinting and it's more available now
so hopefully it's more available and
you're watching this and you can click
the purchase link down there to get it
but it's definitely a game that like
besides the pressure of like it's not
available I definitely wanted to pick it
up and I do think it's interesting there
are two really good abstract games
account this year with sagrada and azul
and i that's really the only comparison
i have is they're two really pretty
really well produced abstract games and
like maybe they're almost competing a
little bit just because they follow that
genre but they're nothing alike so don't
be like oh well there's these two app
share games what should i get buy them
both they're both great it's definitely
just a great experience playing it and I
think it does pass the Tom's mom test
where you know you can play it with
someone you know we kind of say oh if I
can play it with my mother-in-law then
it's a game that is super accessible if
it's hidden we can play to our level as
well and still have fun with it it's
just a solid game I think it would be a
great like he said a family game or
apparently you could play it super
competitive too either way you should be
playing it so you should go to the
description box down below click that
link and get yourself a copy and while
you're down there don't forget to
subscribe so you'll never be bored
so talk more about tools so now you have
a lot just talk about strategy for tools
and

Sakurada this is a game that I've been
wanting to play for a while people have
been sharing pictures of this game from
online from quite a while I keep seeing
them on Facebook and Twitter I'm like
darn how do you how do you get how did
you get that game because as far as I
know it wasn't released yet I saw that
they had copies Gen Con 2017 I run to
the booth of the publisher to get one
and by the time I got there he was sold
out already so what I did was to order a
copy and finally my copy arrived I've
been playing it last week I play without
friends I played it in my seven-year-old
daughter everybody loves this game I can
really tell you my endorsement will be
very enthusiastic this is a great game
and I'm glad that I finally got to plate
in this game you allegedly are building
stained-glass windows for the Sagrada
família it's a fairly after game but it
has very beautiful components and also
the game is aesthetically pleasing not
just a little the components but the
level the composition the rules will
make you place the components in
patterns that as you will see will be
very aesthetically satisfying each
player uses a board such as this one the
top is not strictly necessary but it
looks great this is the play area that
you really want to look at each player
receives the two of these cards randomly
at the beginning of the game each card
is double-sided so you have four
patterns to choose from and the patterns
are not all the same they have different
levels of difficulty as indicated by the
number of dots here at the bottom the
more dots the harder is the pattern and
suppose I decided to play this pattern
here to balance the fact that some
patterns on harder when you select one
you take a number of tokens from this
bag equal to the number of dots that you
have there so here for example I have
five tokens and during the game you can
use these tokens to perform special
actions so the harder the pattern the
more
extra tools you have to complete it once
you select your pattern you slide it
inside inside your board here and voila
now during the game you will place size
in these windows here and you can play
any dye any color any number in areas
with the white background but only dyes
with a matching number nails with the
number and dyes with a matching color in
areas that have a color in the
background also each player receives a
car from the stack you shuffle it and
then you give each card example layer
that indicates a color that to will
score for that play the end of the game
at the end of the game you will be able
to score the sum of the values on the
purple dyes that you have on your board
it could be red dyes it could be yellow
but the secret objective that you have
lets you score the pips each point
indicated on a dye in your play area at
the end of the game there are also
public objectives they come from the
stack you shuffle it and you draw three
randomly face-up and these will indicate
how players can score during the game
one of the ways the other one is the
private objective for example if these
are the three cars that we have this
chart you are gonna score a number of
points equal to the diagonally adjacent
dyes that have the same color pretty
much like indicated here if I had this
pad on the end of the game of score one
two three four five six seven points
because of this objective here if this
is employee is a public objective you're
gonna score six point for each row that
you have in which you have no dice of
the same color it's two points for each
set of three and for anywhere five
points four rows with no repeated values
and so on and so forth so there will be
three of such
cards available for players to take into
account finally something else that we
can use during the game more resources
tools so we shuffled these cards and we
place three cards face up during the
game at the beginning of the game you
ignore this die here it is this symbol
here on the top left corner it is only
used in the solo variant not doing the
multiplayer game and the sullivan by the
way it's pretty fun that's surprisingly
fun and also pretty tough these tools
will be available they have different
effects if you want you can pause and
read what the effect is during the game
what you can do is to use these effects
by spending one of these tokens so you
spend at oh can you say I'm gonna use
that effect under spent at the toe can
use that effect that's how it is now the
core of the game revolves around dice
and you have this nice bag full of
beautiful shiny dies there's 90 of them
that's quite impressive at the beginning
of each turn a player takes the bag and
draws and rolls a number of dice equal
to two times the number of players plus
one so we to play your five dice with
three players seven dice suppose that we
have two players so we draw seven for
here one two three more we roll them and
then starting with the first player the
first player can take can draft can take
a die and place it on their board and or
take an action then the next play will
go the next play will go and then each
play takes a second turn in opposite
order so third player your second play
your first player that means and in most
of what you will be doing is to take
dice from the poll that you're the first
player you're gonna pick first and last
second play your second and second to
last and so on and so forth so when I
take a die I place it on my board again
remember the restriction that
she knew that has to do with the
background there's also another type of
restriction here 408 for that's good
alright another restriction is that I
cannot place well actually before we
talk about that the first time that you
place has to be on the edge of the board
other dyes have to be adjacent to that
one and they have to be adjacent
orthogonal or diagonally diagonally is
perfectly legal I have a five year and
for example I do that and that is
connected but right now I wouldn't be
able to play a diet there because it
wouldn't be connected with my initial
formation but maybe I want to apply a
dozen stat so and I have this die so I
can put it here
I got perfectly legal restriction you
have to follow the instructions on the
background also you cannot place two
dice or toggle early if they have the
same value this purple here may match
the background but I cannot place it
there because these are totally adjacent
to another five and this green here and
we place it here because it is white
background but I cannot actually place
it there because now I am I have two
dyes that were talking I that have the
same color so a diagonal is okay but our
token aliyou cannot have two dyes next
to each other that have the same color
or the same value that means for example
that this would not be a good idea to
place a five here because then it can
not place any dye here because if I want
to place that here has to be a five and
it plays one adjacent there which is a
five so I cannot place anything in there
but I could do this and then maybe I
could do this and so on and so forth but
no more than two dyes per turn since the
number of dice is twice the players plus
one and each player you usually will
take two diesem there will be at least
one dye leftover it can be more players
have passed they died it is left over
after each player took two turns is
placed on the turn track so that also is
a good reminder
trans players have played and how many
are still there maybe in a turn we have
more than one die that has been left
behind because a player passed or
something and there also what is also
interesting is that their game effects
that allow you to swap dice from the
pool of available dice to the turn track
so that is also why the train track is
very important you continue like this
drafting dice from the bag rolling them
getting them and placing them on your
board following all the restrictions
using tools occasionally trying to place
as many guys as possible and to fulfill
as many public objectives as possible
and to get a lot of high values in the
color of your secret objective continue
like this until the end of the 10th
round the game is over players score
points from the public objectives from
their secret objective each token that
they still have is worth one point at
the end of the game of the play at that
point the player with the highest total
is the winner of the game sagrada is a
spectacular game it looks amazing and
gameplay is just as amazing i mean looks
so great that almost i was thinking a
game please not so good I have all these
nice dice I'll do something with that
but then gameplay is absolutely so fun
it's so simple to learn and yet so
interesting so full of nice puzzles nice
decisions that you have to make you will
start by thinking about your display of
course that's your main focus of
attention what you're trying to maximize
try to get certain dice without
committing too much to certain
situations that that will be hard to get
out of if I have a spot in the middle
maybe it's a certain color a nice around
little dice with a lot of value say one
three five and four now there are many
dice that they can place in there so if
I could place for one so be great or for
twos but of course a lot of other
considerations so a lot of different
things that you have to take into
account as you're filling your display
try to fill out the mandated spaces if
you can
leave the blank spaces for later so that
whatever you got in the late game you
can still fill it you can still fit it
in or you have better chances of doing
so and this is enough interesting enough
on top of that you probably will start
booking other people's this place and
your sir realizing look how my friend is
in love with blue all of a sudden I
guess that is their objective and that
it's important it's important because
those secret objectives can be very
powerful
you may even had the impression that
they are too swingy that if I get three
sixes in my collar that gives me 18
points that's a huge bonus may even win
me the game and from time to time might
happen but I don't think that that will
be enough of a factor to swing the game
in a direction rather than another in
many games if the players know what
they're doing either place are aware of
that then as soon as I used to get a
sense of why you're getting a six in
that thing which may not be ideal for
you or maybe good enough then I want to
get fives and sixes in that color if
it's possible for me I want to try to
take them from you so when players are
aware of that I don't think that is as
much of a problem at all
and actually like the other challenge
that comes society from that if I do my
thing and ignore you I may be in a good
position but I may be overlooking ways
of preventing your success then that
could be available to me otherwise so I
like the challenge that you have you and
the dice and then also interact with
other players again what I take is also
related to what I leave on the table so
are two things may be more or less equal
to me then I decide to take one just
because the one that I leave to you is
not nearly as appealing to you
it is a game doll though you're not
attacking each other with mortars
platoons or air bombardments has a lot
of eating director can have a lot of
indirect interaction and the problem
that probably are thinking about well
how about analysis paralysis that is
always possible with their own people
and with games that have perfect
information but you do not have 20
options
you take into account every round the
number of dyes that you have is that one
and if you are the third of the fourth
layer by then you have a small number of
dyes and you're gonna take two so that
also relieves the pressure a little bit
so the pool of options that you had to
consider is not large and that helps
with analysis process or say how's
preventing Liza's paralysis but it is
still large enough that it is
interesting to get to try to solve the
puzzle in the later game when you're
committed to certain patterns and you do
not have many open options then amasses
process is almost impossible when you
realize that there is only one dye that
you can fit you can still choose to pass
because maybe that fits but not as
beautiful as you would want it to be
you're still hoping that another time
may fit better and create other
opportunities but still as the game
progresses and opportunities Andy and
arranger opportunities narrows again you
have fewer choices that you can make and
that hang in house weeds we prevent the
analysis paralysis but yet at the same
time the game doesn't feel trivial
doesn't feel like on autopilot you're
still have to make those decisions which
are still very important and very
interesting and at the end if you get
stuck at three turns from the end your
lies that it's hard to place almost
anything well you're only one person to
blame and he's not your best friend
unless you consider yourself to be your
best friend because of course that is
the outcome of the decisions that you
made early on in the game if you find
yourself without decisions to make then
well you need to reconsider your
strategy I don't think it is something
that is intrinsic to the design I like
the fact that the game again can be
taken different levels we develop little
commitment it can be like a beer and
pretzel games you're playing with your
Uncle John that has come to visit and
you're drinking pretzels anything beer
or approaching those two food things in
the opposite way and you're just
chatting and you're placing dyes there
your planes and support sub-optimally
but the game will still work the game is
still happening in support of
complicated games all the moving parts
that you have to pay attention to what
you're doing you can play tasks just
that casually again many of you are
probably horrified by me saying this but
hey it is your game you bought it use it
any way you want
and if you want to use it casually were
thinking about something else and
updating your Facebook that is your
pirata you can do so but you can take
the game very seriously play it with
deeper layers that take is just as
seriously and the game then that exudes
we depth and we pleasant puzzles to
solve that is I would almost say you can
play as casual almost as as hardcore as
you want it to be you can play with the
vast range of people again with
completely casual gamers we non-gamers
at all with very serious about players
with young folks I play to doing my
seven-year-old daughter Amelia she
spectacular I can't win against her to
save my life for that she's very good at
this game also I must say I don't have
the sense that I'm particularly good
because it looks like answer and I lose
against my adult friends but maybe a
testament to how good this game is that
I always want to play it more although I
seem to lose almost every time it is
just so fun the mental flow that it gets
me into is absolutely captivating the
beauty of interacting with these
components the patterns and the merger
just visually pleasant and the rules of
course will encourage you to create
certain patterns
precisely because the college can now be
orthogonal II adjacent then you cause a
spread you spread the colors around the
nice patterns with a variety a lot of
alternating colors it's beautiful to me
that's that's one of those cases with
the rules of the game can also work as
an aesthetic principle as almost as a
compositional blueprint that that places
the components on the board in certain
patterns that on top of creating
interesting game
decisions also result in pleasing
arrangements of components it's a game
that plays beautifully that is beautiful
that you can play with a ton of people
to me this is a a new gateway classic a
thing that in no time at all this will
be up there on the Olympus of the
gateway games together with pandemic
Ticket to Ride Carcassonne Catan and
definitely I would play this one any
night of the week
over over cap an Ticket to Ride a plate
as a gateway game this one I could place
a gateway game I can play with the
serious committed gamers I can play it
any time because it is just so darn fun
so darn beautiful and rewarding very
satisfying segrada highly recommended in
my opinion a new modern classic in the
making

hi my name's Andrew and I'm a real key
gateway gamer get regimes of one of
those games are gonna get people
interested in the Hobby so if you're new
to game or if you just got friends that
you want to introduce to the Hobby stay
tuned and let's see what's coming to the
table in this week's gateway guys this
week we're all gonna be drafted as
artisans and craftsmen as we visit the
world's most amazing churches creating
the most beautiful windows possible in
sagrada so grab there is a 2 to 4 player
drafting game created by Adam Adam ESCO
and Daryl Andrews it was originally a
Kickstarter game but now it's published
by flood gear games
let's see how it plays in sagrada you're
gonna be trying to fill your window with
as many different dice as you possibly
can
there are 90 in the whole game and to
complete your window you need 20 of them
the difficulty comes into play see for a
six yellow could not go next to a six of
any other color that's orthogonal it and
a yellow cannot go next to another
yellow even if it is a different number
follow those rules of placement and
through a clever drafting technique
where we take the number of players
times up by two and add one to get a
pool of seven dice for a three play
again we'd roll the dice play a wonder
roll of ticks first choice then player 2
and player 3 followed by player three
player 2 and player one when the
remaining dice being placed on the round
track this way of drafting gets tons of
people sat there saying please don't
take the what I'm after please I say
that yellow for there's only a yellow
three that will complete my board please
doctor and of course the other player
will always tell yellow three it's a
really interesting way to introduce some
player interaction in a game that could
really be a solitaire puzzle and there
is a solo version of this game included
hopefully by the end of the game your
board will look something like this a
completed window hopefully following all
of the different rules
it is always key to go back and have a
little check for example here my green
fall is in between two other Falls so
that would be removed from the game but
for the sense of this I'm just gonna
flip that to a to a completed board is
then checked against the public
objectives for example here for every
row with different colors I would score
6 points and I'd manager on each row
they are combined with your private
objectives for me I'd have shades of
blue so I get a point for every blue
pick dice so six points at four points
at one point at five points we combine
all those together add a little glass
beads a point for each one of those that
you didn't use for craftsmen's help such
as after drafting flip the die to the
opposite side you'll get a total and the
player with the most points or win the
master art as an award and become the
champion of sagrada so there we have it
that's Segura a fantastic game of dice
drafting on window crafting
again that will get the whole family
involved it's simple enough for kids to
pick up no matching colors next to each
other no matching numbers next to each
other
follow the rules on the card it's as
simple as that those simple rules mix
with some amazing tension as you're
praying that nobody takes that one dice
that will complete your window the bag
and you forwards and backwards please
don't say that now I probably know
what's it one that you need later all
sorts of interaction involved completed
windows are extremely satisfying at the
end and overall i'd give this kid a
fantastic 9 out of 10 for a gateway game
that's been our first episode of the
gallery guy hope you've enjoyed it I
hope you've seen a game maybe that you
already knew a little bit about and
wanted to know more about oh and you
game to you either way don't forget
gateway games are the greatest games

hey everybody Edo here and this is
sagrada by darryl andrews and adrian
adam sq let me see if I got that right I
think I did I apologize if I didn't and
this is one of those games the hype
train is out of control I saw it online
everywhere everyone talking about
thinking about it posting pictures of it
and it's hard not to argue with that it
is gorgeous and beautiful and the
components everything about this is
solid solid I thought it was actually
going to be smaller it's sort of a big
box but once you get into it you realize
that there's a lot going on here but
this is a larger a larger game and but
it's light and airy and I mean that in a
couple of different ways I probably
should use some sort of stained-glass
metaphor but I failed I'm sorry but so
what's going on - Greta or Citroen
Sagrada is a game with lots of dice and
you are going to be essentially dice
drafting where you roll it's one more -
- / + 1 so I get an a player at 4 player
game you're going to roll 9 dice 8 + 1 -
2 4 6 7 8 - 4 6 7 8 9 okay not so
apostles 9 dice once the first player
rolls it into the box and basically
everyone's taking turns selecting these
dice they never get rolled again and
where you're placing them is in your
stained-glass so super cool thing number
one stained-glass beautiful unique
component but the other part of it is
you put in your you get dealt a number
of these and then you put in your your
spin your board card one you get to
choose which is interesting but also
they have difficulty ratings and it's
like a handicap depending on what you
pick so you could have more gems which
I'll talk about whatever these things
are more more tokens or sort of an
easier layout of the board really
interesting decision once you have
decide you're putting this in and
once it's in you have a couple
restrictions in this game first and
foremost if a put if a spot has a color
you need to use that color dye if it has
a number you need to use that number
second you can never put the same number
or the same color next to each other so
you're going to be taking a dye and
we're trying to fill up the board with
our dice if you do perfectly you have by
the end of the game you'll have exactly
filled up your your your stained glass
window if you've messed up or you have
some conflict you might be missing a few
and you get negative points for that so
the game is really going around the
table picking up a guy placing look at
your looking at what's in there you like
and you're placing placing to give some
some dynamics to that there are few
other elements of the game one everyone
has their own hidden objective maybe you
need to get it you get extra points for
a certain color or setup or whatever so
you each have your own little objective
and there are also bonus objectives on
the table so goal so you have your own
goals where they they're here you have
your own goals and then maybe there's a
team goal so you'll the team goal might
be like hey get for a1 and a2 next to
each other you get two points or you
have comms and no repeated values so
everyone's working on some open
community goals and their own goals for
bonus points on top of laying everything
out then there are also these tool cards
which are little abilities that you swap
spin re-roll and these are what you're
going to spend your tokens on so the
more tokens you have the more tools you
can use otherwise you're playing across
ten rounds nice little system that extra
die gets put here to symbolize the
progress on the track and some abilities
let you use that die really smart once
you're done you flip it over in each
tally your score really smart it's while
playing this I was sort of comparing and
thinking about role player which is was
one of my favorite games and it has a
lot of complexity and some player
interaction this is pretty lightweight
on player interaction this really is
your everyone's just working on their
little puzzle in front of them it's
gorgeous
and
it's nice it passes around quickly yeah
maybe somebody went for a tool quicker
because it was cheaper or maybe somebody
stole your dye and hope that what you're
going to do but for the most part you're
just chilling waiting for the tray to
come to you and playing in some ways it
sort of actually reminds me of
herbaceous it's that sort of light easy
in easy to explain play with anyone not
going to think too hard it's pretty but
you had fun and you enjoyed it so again
going into a million there was the hype
but not knowing much about the game
other than pictures I didn't know really
where it was going to land it lands in
that light accessible gateway cat or
category a really pretty I love that
category I highly recommend this one but
again don't expect too much player
interaction don't expect too much depth
you're going to pull it out but your
grandma to play have some fun and then
perhaps go play another game so but
definitely recommended and really the
number of smart design decisions in this
game is and development decisions is
through the roof amazing components
super smart very impressed so that's the
grata subscribe to share all that good
stuff
most importantly play some great games
thanks bye

I found over the years that my taste of
games have changed a bit when I first
got into games I loved dudes on a map I
loved duking it out with my friends
awesome miniatures just fighting across
great maps I loved it I still do but
then over some time I really just heard
liking really heavy euros the great
mechanisms really trying to figure out
these puzzles always losing to my wife
who's great at these games but I'm
terrible at them but she's great at them
it's fine and now as of late I've really
enjoyed games that can pull out in an
evening just before bedtime they're
really easy to learn really easy to play
but they still give me that great
feeling of thinking hard and still
enjoying that debt that way it is my
brain one game that's done this lately
is sagrada by floodgate games fun
components fun gameplay a fun puzzle to
figure out i'm jacob russell and this is
the gamer curator this game was designed
by adrian adam SQ and darrell andrews
the art and graphic design was done by
peter wolken you've seen some of his
work before trust me I'll put a link
down in the description so you can see
some of his other work this game was
fantastic the artwork is great and so is
a graphic design let's talk about it
looking here you can see how great the
artwork really is so many colors such
bright vibrant colors that really brings
your attention in you can't walk past it
without seeing it right it's just like
huh Sagrada it's just boom it's great
now this does bring up a conversation
though about the importance of Art and
Design and board games there's this
piece here the stained glass player
board and your actual card that goes
that's inserted into it okay now I love
this I think it's fun I think it's
clever and it gives a good look and feel
to the game as you're playing it it
really adds to that experience of
playing it now here's the thing though
it's completely superfluous it really is
the game can be played with just this
card and be just fine but here's what it
does the art brings the game theme to
life and I know this isn't like the most
exciting theme but I love stained glass
windows a lot of people do love stained
glass windows
it's such a unique seam and the art
helps portray this and helps and helps
move that theme along but really what it
does is adds to the player experience
and so let's talk about that one thing I
love about the experience of this game
is the visual aspects of it and how you
interact with those now true I did talk
about it before and these are a bit
superfluous but what they do is they
give you that tactile response placing
the the small beautiful dice in these
squares here it just feels great and it
gives that tactile response that's so
great in games right moving miniatures
around rolling dice these things that
have you interact with the game play and
become involved with it and that's one
thing I think this actually does and so
while it may seem superfluous to others
I see its importance and I see its value
in this game one thing I love about this
game are the puzzle aspects to it I love
trying to figure out where to place the
dice how to make sure everything can fit
I love that sometimes you feel this
anguish over not being able to fill your
your board completely because you made
an error and you see that error you're
like what was I thinking and you
actually like have this anguish about it
and I love when a game does that such a
simple premise but it's such a great way
to bring you into the game and to make
it memorable and to make you want to
play again this is not a long game right
you can teach it in five minutes and
play it and you'll want to play it again
right after to see how you can do better
one thing I love about this game is the
variability I love the different tools
you can use how to implement those tools
into your strategy which changes every
time because the the dice available to
you change every turning you're still
trying to figure out this puzzle and
it's not different it's not the same
game every time and I absolutely love
that one thing I loved about this
experience was how deep the gameplay
really is I love when a game has simple
mechanisms and seems simple at first but
once you get into it you're trying to
figure out this puzzles you're trying to
wrack your brain around the best way to
do this while everyone else is trying to
do the same thing and I love when a game
can can bring people in and do that and
cause people to be interested and
engaged on everybody's turn because
you're you're sitting there you're
thinking no please don't take that dice
I need that
I need those dice please don't take it
and they take it like crap what am I
supposed to do now and you throw it and
you throw a fit and you're like I always
supposed to have those dice okay I don't
do that I'm very calm calm player I
whined a bit sometimes I get ye it's
fine
overall as you can tell I love this game
of the experience you have trying to
figure out the puzzles trying to see how
you can block other people and they
don't block you and you're trying to see
exactly what you can do to create the
best puzzle that you can to solve that
that puzzle I love when a game does art
works so well and has gameplay to
support that artwork where it's
integrated where it's not just bling it
doesn't just look good but it actually
plays well and I love that I love how
easy it is to teach how easy it is to
show friends and to show them the
excitement that board games can bring I
love entry level games like this super
fun that's sagrada by floodgate games

hey everyone board game grg here today
I'm unboxing Sagrada which was a
Kickstarter game that I just received in
the mail today it's a dice drafting game
where you're trying to build stained
glass windows so let's see what's in the
box here uh we have the instruction
manual glossy paper full color uh it's
only like one 11 by 17 sheet of paper
though full and half so not too many
directions how to play should be a
pretty straightforward game to get
started on here we have the D dice tray
this was a stretch goal that was met so
you can just pop this out and construct
a little travel dice tray wherever you
go the score marker I believe for the
end of the game we have some glass
tokens here similar to those from
viticulture if you're familiar with that
game we have a nice thick dice drafting
bag here with the name of the game on it
sangr and a smaller one I forget what
that's for I have to look in the
instructions and then we have these
multicolor dice which are the heart of
the game uh miniature dice not
full-sized and then we have the cards I
think these are different tools that you
can draft in the beginning or maybe
purchase and this is where all of the
dice are kept so you have these stained
glass boards each player receives each
one's a different color and you slide
Cards into the bottom and that's where
you place the dice as you draft them
so we have a red and like a greenish
base maybe one with some purple
here U and then this is the kickstarter
exclusive one with the little
Kickstarter
K and
underneath we have some tokens I think
these are going to be the scoring tokens
for the end of the game that go on the
scoring board and then the cards that
actually slide into the
bottom of the player boards here so
they'll just slide up up and then you
can put your dice in the appropriate
slots as you draft them so I'm really
looking forward to getting this game to
the table uh it's only been a few months
since I backed it so it wasn't too long
of a Kickstarter fulfillment time but
yeah everything fits pretty nicely into
the box I know the dice tray has to be
broken down each time but that's not a
huge deal it's only five
pieces but look for my review on
boardgame greg.com after we've had a
couple playthroughs of it and thanks for
checking out the video

today on game night Nikki Lincoln Aaron
and myself Dave are going to play
sagrada a game for one to four players
published by floodgate games and
designed by darryl andrews and adrian
adam s qu so let's build our stained
glass windows ah pretty hey Dave
hey Lincoln will you teach us sagrada i
will in sagrada we are all artisans
trying to build the most beautiful
stained-glass window and by most
beautiful I mean highest scoring a nice
last window I mean these dice alright
the game is gonna take place in ten
turns and a turn consists of whoever the
start players did I just do it by
perfect to no six no by one the start
player is going to draw for the bag in a
four player game nine dice which is
number of players times two plus one all
right that's the form in the Frawley
ways you're gonna roll those dice and
then you're going to draft them so as
the start player i would draft one of
these dice and put it somewhere here in
my window then nikki would do the same
then Lincoln then Aaron and then settler
style we go backwards from there and
then Aaron would take another one then
Lincoln the Nikki and from the two
remaining or maybe more I would take one
and put it here whatever die or dice
don't get used they go here on the board
alright to indicate that's around if
there's more than one you just stack
them up or something good next to the
focus but they go back into it no they
don't go back yeah okay here alright
interesting there are five colors of
dice and there are eighteen of each what
are you trying to do here on this board
well we're all gonna have one of these
little stained-glass templates that
slide in the back of our window frame
and create this little pattern right
here like I have you will see that some
spaces are white and some spaces have
color and some spaces have numbers or as
they like refer to them in this game
shade the three is a lighter shade than
a five which is a lighter shade than the
six and you can see it actually right
here in this card see how the one is the
lightest but they all have either a
color or number and that is a
restriction for that space so I can only
place purple here here here
and only red here and only yellow here
and only a six here regardless of color
and only a three here regardless of
color
additionally there are global placement
restrictions in which you can never put
a dye orthogonal e next to so right left
up down another die of the same color in
this case two purple next to each other
so that's no good
or the same shade / number so I can't
put a four next to a four okay alright
so for example if I had a purple six I
would never put it here or here on the
six because I am killing the space next
to it I can never put a dye there
all right so that's round one then the
start player will pass and we'll just do
that for ten rounds and at the end of
ten rounds you have twenty spaces so if
you actually fill them up that'll be
exciting because if you didn't break any
of those rules and see cuz I haven't
gotten a specific set of scoring but
your score is going to be based on these
three scoring cards which we just pulled
randomly there are three random scoring
cards for every game plus we'll all have
a secret scoring card the secret scoring
cards are just one of the five colors
and we'll all get have the most amount
of snow well I'll get one whatever color
that is so if I got yellow I'm gonna
score face value all my yellow Oni so I
want nothing but yellow sixes if I get
you a little tool but I also still
needed to make my thing okay let's talk
about scoring before I get up here to
the tools medium shades this is going to
score for every pair of the three four
you have just anywhere on your board
you're gonna get two points so if what
we're done I have three threes on my
board and two fours on my board I'm
gonna get four points because I have one
three four and a second three oh they
don't have to be a genius no just going
to be on the gist you look at your whole
board Nate count up your 3s count up
your fours
Frary is a lot whatever the equal pairs
are you get two points for that you can
get five points if each of these columns
that you have is different is four
different colors of the
so you can score with that up to 25
points because you're gonna score each
column separate not likely though not
likely it's correct but not impossible
to do right additionally this one is
numbers / shades the other direction
this is going to score five points if
all five die in your row are different
num number / shades and you can score up
the 20 points with that one if you can
make that happen that's also really
they're all really hard yeah I mean
they're not really hard they're hard to
get to get all a lot of yeah yes they're
not hard to get some okay now what I
haven't explained are the tools the
tools are basically rule breakers and
they work as follows we are going to get
at the beginning of the game just two of
these cards randomly all right they are
double sided you are going to look at
all four sides and pick which one you
want to play all right they have little
dots at the bottom this one has six dots
this one has five that one has three the
fewer dots that are on the card the
easier the card is hmm okay but what
you're going to get for each dot is one
of these stones so if you play the three
dot card you're gonna get these three
stones okay any stones that you haven't
spent by the end of the game are worth a
point but you can spend stones to use
these tools alright so let me explain
what the tools do you can only use one
tool per turn so you can't use to on a
turn to sort of daisy chain them in this
tool the copper foil burnisher allows
you when you put a stone on the card to
use it you can move any one die in your
window and you may ignore the shade
restriction which is to say the number
doesn't matter anymore so if I had a
four over here I'm gonna be legal if I
had a four over here I could use this
tool to move this four where this five
is on my board note I can't I couldn't
do that
if there was a redneck this was a red
next to it or if there was a four next
to it the adjacent
see restrictions still applies it's just
this card allows you to ignore the
printed numbers okay okay all right so
so in that regard that was one way I
could get unhand out from that situation
that I am doing on yes yeah I could put
a six here because in theory I could
move a forward in there was no way of
fixing your artisanal mistakes right it
was all planned yeah well you know a
good artist works with what he's got
again you're moving a dye in your window
and you're ignoring shade restriction
you have to obey all the other
restrictions I so the other thing that I
didn't tell you was that the first dye
you place when you start the game is on
the edge somewhere including the corner
including the corners all subsequent
dice that you place must touch a dye
previously placed on your board for
purposes of touching diagonal is okay
okay okay so if you were to place a four
here
my next placement could be any of these
five spaces diagonal is okay for
purposes of placing a dime so so you I
like to start my windows in the middle
just have floating as you can all right
my point thing is if I start from the
edge is that yes shirt on you have to
start from the edge and then one point
it's your hair you make a stained glass
when you can't just stick a piece in the
middle I mean you can lay it out but
you're not gonna weld in it solder it
back please
if this were my board I could not use
this tool and take this four and put it
over here where the six is because this
is not touching anything right you have
to obey all other restrictions okay if I
had to die here then I could move this
for over to there and it is okay in
moving the four that I have created this
gap where the V while this touch was
diagonally but if that were there it
would be okay if I moved this four and
created that gap okay that makes sense
because it's touching the edge because
it was already know because these were
already placed legalizing this die has
to just you have to obey all other
placement restrictions from the die you
are moving okay
this tool the lens cutter basically
after drafting you're going to take a
draft to die then you are
to use that tool and what you're gonna
do is you are going to swap that dye out
for any dye on me that's cool yep there
will be minimum nine dice on the track
there could be more depending on if
people don't draft so whoever moves the
dice over to the round track at the end
we need to make sure that they don't
change the value of the shade of the
dice either right right because they
could come back into play that way right
and the reason that there could be more
than one at the end is that you don't
have to draft a dye if you choose not to
draft a dye you can just leave it there
later in the game when you have more
difficult placement restrictions you may
not be able to draft in place a dye all
right the rules as printed are such that
you cannot draft to die if you cannot
place it that is how we will be playing
today the accepted rule by the designer
is that you can also play the other way
if you want in which even if you can't
place a dye you can essentially like
hate draft upstream from the vehicle and
the next player to take a dye away from
them okay we're not playing that way so
it won't happen right away it might not
happen at all but it could be by like
around seven eight or nine that there
are dice that can't be used and they
might end up on this track in multiple
dice on the track and the flux remover
after drafting you die you put it back
in the bag
then you draw a die out from the bag at
random and make that any number you want
but whatever color you get is the color
you're stuck with okay so there's
another example of a way that add I
might end up here because it might just
might not be a placeable once you
correct and in which case you would make
it any number you want and put it back
in the pool Wow
so you could be get you could help
somebody out there it's very unlikely
gonna happen you are you will you will
again you could pull exactly the wrong
color all right it could be that you're
trying specific for a color it's usually
that you want a number more
can you use that and this lets you set
the number correct but you get whatever
color you get right here's how these
work as far as what it costs to use the
card if there are no stones on a card
which is to say the first time these get
used by any of us it's 1 and you put it
on there
after that all subsequent uses of that
card cost you two and by the way you can
use one I can do that turn one and on
turn three I can do the same thing in
that if I want to so so you you want to
potentially use them early when they're
cheaper but you might not need them
early right and also it depends on how
many of these you have if you have three
stones where he's going to be you first
on one of them at least at least four
not again at the end of the game you're
gonna score two points for this two
points for every pair five points for
every column five points in this case
for every row you're gonna score one
point for every one of these you didn't
use you're gonna score face value for
this and then you are going to subtract
one point for every empty space in your
window did you say are using this tool
is is your action instead of not taking
advance in addition addition so you're
always gonna draft a die in place one
assuming that you can suit right or
unless you choose not to right you can
also use a two on your turn or not to
you can in fact use a tool and then go
and I'm not drafting a die okay hmm
it's unlikely you'll do that especially
if you do the one where you're swapping
out a die or the one you might not do it
when you will you have to draft the die
to use that tool but you might want to
do this you might want to move a die and
then not draft anything just to do it
ahead of time because it's cheaper that
turn or I don't know that's the whole
game so let's just do we get to see our
secret color B don't reach you yes you
do here's the two three you knows
there's two for you there's two for you
there's two of me they're all pretty
hard there are definitely hard ones my
my experience with this game is you
actually don't really want the three
I wouldn't start at anything I would
definitely pick a four over three
there's your secret color all right let
me do that one well my secret thing
didn't help me at all mine either
well but that's okay right you have
plenty of white spaces what do you get
for okay go ahead and stick it in first
[Music]
I did for what it's worth
two of them were sixes so it wasn't like
I know between the five and the oven was
a three I actually had my mom five or
six I've gotten that before I actually
have a three four or five six a wide
variety of choice I would like to have
one two three four
their first player it's on camera
Nikki goes first okay only took six
drives that's why we usually do that off
camera okay one two three five six I
hope she comes him every time seven
eight I went I wasn't feeling them no I
like your hair I like days Miha just
like well at nine I hope so there's all
kinds of the thing that's kind of fun
about the game is to see everyone's
individual method for how they pull the
dice out of that so we got a one yellow
the one green six red to red to purple
what do we know blue no blues taking
that five okay EMS we start on your head
somewhere don't be putting it in that
purple spot that's well you can you can
stop you can still put it here start
over here
to start cigarette butt nope I'm gonna
do a green okay four okay four four
green shade you changed your mind I
wanted to break a rule you can go there
next tray because remember diagonal
touches that counts for me oh yeah boo
can I say boo hey that's purple five
might still be there Sookie I think I do
six well yeah probably
well again it depends on what this is
and it also depends on angling for this
now right right so for example Nikki
doesn't want to put a blue or a triple
here well she couldn't put a blue it's
illegal but she might not want to put a
purple there if she's going for that
column but she might also just say no I
don't care for that call her blue five
purple e5a well I will take a leash
that's interesting so if I take the one
oh I can do that okay
wow that's terrible this game is awesome
I'm gonna take the red two and put them
here and then I will take the green one
the green one the green one there you go
the green one one that's my whole turn
Aaron will take first he'll take
Manhattan so I have to place adjacent to
that or diagonals this is kind of venal
counts as adjacent which changing its
changing Lincoln's window has not set
you can spoil this is terras copper
frames are not use them tries to rip it
apart so I'm taking this yep
because I can't anyways yep all right
that goes here it up and that's run wood
all right link in the rule seven dice
roll man two more
nice ugh I knew that a surgeon hath one
you said two times players plus one well
I said nine looking for that formula
every turn come on how many did you get
you know that is oh wait there's one
dunno there it's right there it's mine I
counted nine nine Wow yeah agreed
that's horrible agree it is I'm not
happy with it yes sir I'm also not happy
with it Wow mm it's pretty bad
well you have tools at your disposal if
you need them ah well you can place a
yellow six yeah you have some options
but I can't place that blue three which
would be wonderful to get start and
going in that direction why not there's
a three right there oh well you can
place the blue three but you don't want
to yeah that's right you can decide to
ignore that later but yeah I would agree
I want to pick things that are low in
number of colors okay so you oh yeah I
just did exactly what I can't do
let's do that oh right that would be
silly now I can't see your bow it's a -
it's this way right yeah but it's - yeah
take the green four and put it next to
the to the other way does that work no
he's got a four right there it's for
here huh yeah well looks like those
things I could do it's me - yellow sick
okay yeah that's pretty good
accept it - six here but it's this way
that we worry about different numbers
but the other six diagonal yeah oh yeah
right if you're doing the different
numbers thing yeah this is bad it's like
you know what's what's the future no no
it's just the things in the future right
future hold yes how would someone know I
don't know that's a better move anyway
Lincoln because that's a very good like
if I could have gone diagonally I think
going diagonally early helps you spread
out to other toes agree didn't want to
do these things with blue here I was
sort of unable to do that unfortunately
I can't up a note the lack of red there
that one
that's the only color I need on my board
well that's all you like color I have is
blue I know it's when I'm yeah got a lot
of blue in there alright well I guess
I'm taking you get some red wine take a
red you'd be quiet
is there a three in there and he can
make it there are two yellow three
excellent
oh well then one will still be there for
me mmm perhaps there will so yellow
maybe Nicky will take them both you know
what I'm taking this be done okay
yeah are you done are you done I mean I
can only be done I only get one die I am
done you could change a purple purple
six there and then a purple one cuz
diagonals okay okay or that or that
yellow six
anyway that's fine you need she wants
the one yeah well this has to be a one
yes I do have a sixth as me a six and
this has to be a purple right right but
the oh he's saying is you could then put
the yellow six right you can instead of
this you could put the yellow six there
yeah just just yeah it's hard to but it
doesn't matter they're all hard anything
you have lettuce but she knows for a
fact this is not a red or a green right
if she's going for this that's true
whereas this can be anything right now
right yes all right I'm gonna take that
another yellow three since it's still
there done the tool time yet no tool
time well good it's early it's green its
early
you can't do the to anything I think I
have to do that one just because that
too is bad that's right next the other
two and then that goes right there hey
guess what another tip hey Wow unhelpful
that's awesome
yeah that's awesome so my point earlier
was there are some people that roll them
one at a time out of the bag I like to
just take this and then see how many you
need and it's pretty close I only need
one more I'm not gonna take more than I
need because you don't want to roll too
many right so there we go yeah those are
terrible those are pretty terrible no
they know what you're doing I like them
oh yeah pretty bad those are terrible
they're fine they're fine are they are
they they are they're fine are they yep
yes and I right or am i right you are
it's okay but don't take the blue file
are you we could do the two red Dave
that would work I can't there's a tee
right here perfect you so much hate you
so much
aggressive drama out of nine dice I took
the one you needed yes I'm gonna take
devisor blue three please sir no sir I
can't do that oh sweet it's terrible the
Council of stained glass window makers
disagrees with that rule
okay a blue one then thank you
there you go Nikki may have blue three
hmm you guys suck I need blue to get
across this board yeah you do well I can
go diagonally with the green three or
yep hey I'm in that same problem your
end yeah you need red to like get out
because someone didn't roll correctly I
know well I gave you two Reds you just
didn't want them
you didn't roll correctly I already
choose chose poorly here right because
of the two over here oh yeah but you can
always that's why you can move that's
why they have tools well more
importantly that's what it's not even
mrs. Harry Martin but I'd like to try
like I don't want to spoil it every row
what you still completely you absolutely
still Kim that you can cover that too
with something else
as long as it can legally go there later
yep I guess I could do a - I just
occurred to me I have to take another
one of these oh no I can't do it - yeah
that's nobody these are not good there
Wow three could go there
I was hoping one would stay around with
Kanaka po3
I know I just took them shouldn't have
taken that blue three oh boy the boys
are but our boisterous agreed yeah I
think that'll be safe a safe choice
don't so 5 red you know there's an oaken
Hall sure you don't want to put it here
yeah it's not bad either
only because remember this has to be
ellen this has to be greens right in
case you get hemmed in earlier and also
it gives you the diagonal out to reach
more stuff yeah right if you're gonna
place the five red that's where I would
have put it that will work yes thank you
Dave
welcome it's also the dye one of them
and I will live with the five green you
didn't want that to read I know
no I do right here oh I'm sorry I keep I
know I know
yeah I think I'll T it's hard to see
that well we're gonna put it to up on
the board I've so let you oh yeah I'm
very sure everybody don't forget these
are available to you all these to sorry
you might need it to later it might be
the number like look at Lincoln he's
getting close to being troubles no I'm
saying if if you don't put it if you're
going for this for example and you avoid
the twos you know you always have one
right
you can't do the crazy weird one except
for four five six seven eight
no I don't even needed to see what the
other ones there let me just take that
red six Wow okay I'm not missing that's
exactly the thing that is going right
there yeah and this needs to be a 1 or a
6 right if I'm gonna try to make that
okay oh right yeah let's see but you
unless you know unless you use some
copper foil burnishing on that that
window true you can't do that mm-hmm you
know we need some fours on there man Wow
there's one for it's true I don't have a
signature not the right color though
that's the way the game works don't
forget you have tools okay I'm gonna
take them yeah I like how that was a
very deck litter is declarative
statement right up until dot dot okay
I'm definitely gonna take green a4 crap
all right Aaron no I'll take all right
that was it I need a six down here okay
what else would you like is it me I get
to go twice yes it's exciting
yeah I don't know that it is twos and
threes there seems dumb house I guess I
need a three also and red will complete
my four color column okeydoke
and yeah man it's legal laws also and I
hate it I can do it so yeah all right
link is hoping there'd be less choice
cuz it's all awful I think I should you
do it - okay which there is a few
choices there there's red and there's
yellow and there's green technically
they do this one here well if you didn't
take that for wonderful here's
keep taking the ones and call me I just
that would have worked for me now I
couldn't place it before but branching
outs also good that's also has the
benefit of taking the day I want it
again yeah okay that's the way the game
works well purple 3 goes here from
perfectly right and fills that whole
thing with different colors so now that
I can't do that I guess I'm gonna take
the blue take it blue 3 and put that
there to again know how funny
alright thanks Nikki here you go star
player alright I'm not gonna do the
inter in there for fun there's five six
seven eight
linking you're getting a blue for
whether you like yeah happy I need it
look at that a lot of times all the
doors there's points for foresight know
that up well it doesn't matter I'm going
third I'm fourth one
there's okay there's enough force that
you can still have four for all okay
hmm
Dave I hope this is the only for you can
use them that's the one you want it was
the one I needed to get you know I can
still put it down here but I did I did
need that foot before there that was
beautiful and by beautiful I mean Chris
you curfew and also may I say curse you
okay well before not before I don't get
a for let's do that and then probably
another probably the five on the five
South a five on the five done but yes
that purple that was a non sweets not
you Nikki it's a it's errands errands
you're gonna be last you're gonna have
two choices it all right I think I'm
gonna take a one well nobody take the
two whatever happens so we can have at
some point we're gonna need twos
actually I look I do need it too yeah I
think I think I like this one I guess I
could put the purple one there purple
tail yeah since I put it to there it
isn't gonna be that which we if you want
that multicolored what's what's under
your green three anything is it white
can you lift your green quainter six a
three has to be three okay I was gonna
say you can move the three to the two
space yeah
what's under the yellow three blank okay
you could move the yellow three to the
two space and then you could put the one
in the hole where the yellow three came
from or you can even put the one in that
upper corner if you wanted so how do I
do that if you want to do it you would
spend a gemstone to do this one right
then you get to move a die ignoring the
number on the board so you could move
that yellow three to where the three is
short or the two is next to your four
and then you can either place the yellow
one where the three was to give you your
colors to do that or you could put it up
in the
corner to cover the one well because
that is then you resonate your touch
area right yeah but you used to have
options then yeah yeah let's just do
that because it's hard no one's got
needed right there and I need to get
across yeah you wouldn't put up your
word possibly that also gives you the
chance to get this five point bonus
right makes sense yeah now is the one
okay they're just making sure yeah okay
yeah it fills his row right and leaves
the there you go before and now this is
more expensive for the rest of us right
right yeah and now Nikki gets one of
those yeah take the two oh don't break a
streak yeah
whichever one works yeah actually that
blue three is perfect it is and I guess
I think it's are another pair too it
gets their two points no matter what oh
yeah the purple two works too
my feeling is you have no shortage of
two's there is that but and those are
some crazy purple is actually the better
colour there because yeah if you can do
this sort of situation yes now any diet
that's not blue if it's here right but
so if you put the purple two here then
you are giving yourself better chances
to fill that hole later whereas if you
pulled say the green to from there that
makes this one color harder right but I
say bird in the hand Kate take the two
points three point three oh yeah you
need threes that's totally easy well as
a pair right now well she's got three
threes oh I didn't see the thumb but
even so you're right
I thought she I thought she had Felicia
says more force to make that I thought
it was two is probably the better choice
right there you go there's your blue
three Lincoln it's there for you now if
you need it you know because later it
only cost you twice 101 gems for now
make sure I don't roll more than 91 more
it's always eight when you try for now
okay once again the lack of red I find
your lack of register
I really need other I mean blue to would
be helpful here a blue six is not good
no no I guess it isn't no it's not
yeah well yeah it's not not for what he
where he needs to places blues well you
could win and down take a four if that
helps
I do need a four ladies you know for
this yeah there's only one for oh no
there's a purple for that's what it's
gonna be it has to be and I'll get
what's left
it sucks cuz I'd like to use the blue
let me see I can't do the six can't do
the six can't do the three I couldn't
want to get over here but oh wait maybe
I could do a five is there a fight and
he'll know it's bad you could draw a
fight from the bag as long as it's not
red or blue oh I have to do something
now Yorgi new it's probably gonna be the
belief six but let me just look Thank
You Lincoln it's just hard to see I just
think it's so dangerous to move his dice
one though face I was trying too hard I
know you did but like knowing I've seen
again not why I'm still not across the
board really I am kind of now but you
only have one this is a painting of by I
was yeah it is that actually is like
that's more a place to get to oh this is
terrible I can't even place that for I
mean I could I could do that and take
those colors trations and say goodbye
colors diction's alright bird in the
hand
please sakes done okay oh I can't place
it there it's gonna do it and I can't
and I can't place it there I needed a
place that I think I'm I'm gonna be in
trouble on blues I need you yeah I could
not place well there's one here that's
true yeah I guess I think you go in the
corner if you can just get to the corner
dang it yeah but that's still it's only
gonna be one I can tell you right yeah -
I can tell you right now I can guarantee
you right now I'm not I will not be
taking it I have no actual place to play
it so if Aaron or Nikki takes it that's
your only worry right now right but I
don't need a three I would have played I
would have taken it already yeah no you
have a place for it you three goes
perfectly in that lower corner but
you're not there yet right took the four
yellow okay
and then for you now what and for yours
no way my next turn I mix the magical
trip take a three
what are you do that I am going to do
this yeah I'm gonna take this do that
bag let's goes back in the bag
so what are you trying to do now are you
Polly's yes now I draw I draw dive this
is my drift
whatever I draw is my die I can make it
any number I want okay but it's whatever
color I get all right purple no that's
not true Dave you were yes no you choose
a value then you put it in the pool and
you can draft any dye you want you don't
have to draft that dot got it but
clearly but clearly it's going to be the
most valuable to you most likely fact
that purple for is gonna go right there
so that works out okay I'm deaf that
wasn't a red but at least it was
something yeah it's bad I think this was
a dumb idea I thought I'll probably work
out fine all right the same problem
right you guys know cuz you guys both
chose harder ironically look I have he's
a local boy oh yeah I think I need this
one right here folks that was a 1 I
guess I can do that purple - thank
goodness there you go
something payi a three does it wait
alright that was that was six rounds
lincoln's turn yeah here we go nine dice
I'm getting in I'm getting nine this
time I'm trusting a very green on here
either would be nice - you don't need a
degree it was I I I got everyone will be
good right here green would be good it
can't be good there you got some green
one red Lincoln and no blue what the
heck you guys and fire there's 18 of
each color right you said there were I
guess I'm getting a green Wow and I need
a green six snag that blue
in here oh crap that doubles up oh wait
no green is okay in the row it's the
numbers in the row that is exactly what
I need
thanks guys gods all right
I don't think I can use I'm in trouble
here too
I can't place green it's got to be blue
uh-huh
this was a terrible placement but it was
you know it was something it worries the
mover it keep more and more difficult
thank you for before done okay I would
like the green three no I can't place it
sorry
no they're all right look I'm gonna pull
them that finger green I turn to cuz I
can't do the green five either yep okay
in the corner and you get a second
choice yeah another one would be good
hmm
you can guarantee one but it might not
be the color you need that green five
word yep that works great and it gets
you oh okay cool I was gonna say at the
bottom oh yeah that gets me to that -
but that's good there - yeah mm-hmm
there but that has to be a five what
that has to see that can be one of these
crimes that could blow these blues for
me right it just means a can't be a blue
five any five right yeah well I guess
you're right wolf then then ignore me
but again he's still go for the what
does that turn how he's doing that one
you you just swap anything for something
on the time no you drafted I write and
then you put it on the track record
another dial better you use a key what
do you think man what do you like what
do you got I got a three or a five oh
yeah I get one more of these they're
terrible you can't use that red three no
it's the three over thirty I can I can
blow this column and put
five here and not worry about it I'm at
that point now where exist I can't worry
about getting every I cannot us things
anymore I I am just trying to get my
board filled just pick them both up this
one's gonna go right sons I wanted a
purple five and then blowing my bonus in
this column just because there were two
but I don't always
I gotta get want to make sure I play
safe yeah before I go ahead where they
sell you work what can I use then I mean
I can place it I just don't love any of
those hey if you can place it that's
something so if you do this one you can
it doesn't matter what the number of
place it lets you I could switch this
blue to here and Nick step three as long
as the blue is no you cannot place that
it's a shame because you can't put a
three next to a three okay but this one
allows you to do is ignore the printed
number on your card it turns the card
into a white space okay does that make
sense yeah it is confusing because they
use a different definition of shade
versus color when they say shade what
they really mean is a number is value
yeah but that's phonetically I get it
correct yeah right a one is lighter
stained glass than a six and be cools
the dice for actually six shades and of
purple and six shades of red done each
so the six faces oh I liked it there
they have come pretty those nobody extra
don't be a vanity wouldn't be as
translucent yeah you have so much glass
I guess these are somewhat the same for
me I need I'll take the red here we go
you could if you made them expensive
expensive dice yes one two three mmm ah
this one's a wedge so it's like this
triangle shape and they all go together
right for the faces so in the center
there's like I don't think what I need
from you three oh but I want whatever it
is I just want to make sure there's some
red and some blue in here for my friend
Lincoln and myself hey 8:05
you got your Reds red six
is not good that goes right there I
might me to think twice about it yeah
yeah I put them closer to you alright
well I've read okay I think that's legal
I mean okay are your decision-making
Joy's man I want that blue I can't place
it like a place that no I can't
they cannot place it you could place it
and then use two stones later to cover
that six with a different number that's
true you could swap the blue sticks out
for the blue three so that it stayed
there for you in case you were desperate
for it later although that wouldn't be
the six is sort of ugly for you anyway
is that a one in the top corner yes yeah
can't you tell me the shade that's true
I can't kind of yeah it's right it's the
lightest one well I can place the green
six it does fiddle with this though
which is gonna be it's one two I can
only do I'm not gonna make that across
thing put the belief six in the bottom
corner right
it gets you the cross bonus right and
then maybe you can cover that six later
or maybe you just lose a point at the
end depending right right I don't know
what your bonus color is but if it's
blue then at least taking that get you
six points right does that make sense
nothing or thing you can do which is
whenever your bonus color is you can
just try to take high numbers in that
color and just hope that that's enough
points to did you want that six what was
it serious leagues I just um no I mean I
would have taken it if you didn't take
it but I didn't really need it I think
I'm gonna take this grim six
actually yes the green six then let's
see there's two thousand two of those
the yellow is kind of a milky cottage
ooh I'm gonna use the lens cutter no
one's used it yet yeah okay I'm gonna
put this green four up here and take a
red too oh okay that's me again yeah hmm
like Dave said there was always gonna be
a two when you needed it yeah and you
needed it okay so oh crap what I needed
to I'm just gonna swap where I put my
green six that's what I needed to do
okay so this illegal same turn still
legal
okay what's under your green five linked
in anything a five da yeah it's hard
okay
oh it's ugly it's tough hey that's tough
when the dice mean like a dice game
right when the dice don't come your way
and and also these don't necessarily
help right
like I like this card as a tool but
often these are really on how just right
but for example knowing that there are
two green tubes I can always place a
green two right here if I need to
right I've left my side an upright that
was cool
okay I'm taking the one red although
ironically there's one but I don't know
that I should do it right I almost want
to keep my options that will hang on
this is totally illegal so I can't place
that even if I wanted to
you have literally nowhere I don't
really know where to I can place that so
I will be throwing away my option ah but
you could swap this for like a green 3
or a blue 3 if you wanted to then still
have your green to option available back
can you yell at you there no no no our
blue 3 nor our green 3 green or green
for none of those can go there nothing
on that really think oh here is a green
2 or a blue - yeah
there's green twos their leaves ease up
that's why he's saying you left that
leaving that spot over all these green
tails I'm getting myself the option good
job Dave well we'll see all right dr. P
oh yeah even living role but it's we've
done eight so with the I should have all
done this twice I am just teasing he was
joking with me you rolled that one right
yes okay come on Nicky roll at least two
blue fours so the only King can get one
does that what he needs them yeah
there's five you know she'll take it you
don't have it no she won't
tomorrow one more blue for well it's I
love it he called it
that's awesome called shot there's a
gerado this there's a tool in the game
that we're not playing that allows you
to place a stone on it and take two dice
and that's your home right you know you
get music that's kind of interesting -
yeah yeah be spectacular for you right
now
it's what I need yeah well that other
one can be ably 6 I know yes that other
one if I do my thing you've already Bund
it with the other six so the other one
can now be a blue six right here yeah
that can be a blue sick but I have to do
that modification here where that
correct I have to pay the tailor but you
haven't it anyway because you've already
bound it with the other place of course
you know or just lose a point to
anything right like if you spend two
points to put a dye there it should also
score your bonus because otherwise
you're spending to to not lose one is
there any one that I can change the dye
face to there's this one where you can
draft the dye for the bag and make it
any color you want
this one allows you to move a die now by
the way it says move and die in your
window ignoring shame restriction you
can move a die from anywhere to anywhere
right you could go to a white space
about you don't have to ignore state
restriction you could just move a die
right does that help you really move a
die and then place one somewhere else
what are you trying to do which what's
your ideal diet placement here what's
under here it has to be purple
you'd move the six to there yeah and
then you could put you can't put a
purple three there no no purple threes
and no purple for I think trying to get
I come from the bag something from the
bag but that's pretty risky
do I have to place it nope you can just
put it back in the dice pool and then
pull something else in fact this would
be the good time to do it I guess in
case you say - yep so you take one of
these and put it back in the bag what I
can Doug what's she looking for back in
back what's the worst one up there for
you what's the one that you absolutely
can't place even if you wanted to the
green the green five unfortunately ok so
put it back in the bag
cuz it doesn't help and then I draw yep
that goes in the bag first though you've
met Drive you might end up drawing it
again yes we should make it a nomination
counted yellows because that's really
what I need well you might you might get
what's like an awful lot of them are out
there's what you can always do like you
can always hit with this one I mean
that's you've given yourself options hey
here we go was it okay anywhere you want
or take something from the day shoes and
make a number you make a number and then
place it or you make a number and put it
back in the pool and draft the different
diving right okay what would I draft if
I put this back good question nothing
works no so true blue a blue six works
right here well you can make it it was
sexy blue six works right there right
you're already not getting this the very
least you can get this but it breaks
that well that's already broken because
of the red I know it's gonna seem crazy
but a belief for also works there
right cuz you don't care if these
numbers are doubled up you just want the
colors to be different right and a for
would give me uh does everybody have a
mate a four would allow you to maybe
move this later and get there now that's
a three
nevermind idea for because then I've got
ya para fornication yes cuz the four was
there you know but she took a gamble
right yeah yeah there's really hoping
for a better yellow or a better green
yeah those greens here but it has to be
a great thing those I think
yeah well or any fix right as long as
it's it just has to be a non beliefs
when you do something with one of these
that happy I mean I got to think about
watching what are you guys for me like I
cannot place we're just not great yet
huh actually the blue four is actually
pretty good go right there it goes right
there it's I don't want you to take that
one but yes
I just bump this that there were two
yellow ones no that's what I needed it
helps both of those rows so go ahead
Dave
take two they're small well red five for
sure standing by would you like a yellow
one there are plenty of those no purple
three is illegal yellow one is he all of
those are illegal I literally cannot
place any of them yeah like to change
one of them decide I don't like to spend
two no no I'm gonna take that I'm gonna
take your green green to guarantee
bamboo I can put right here and then
your windows all objective I just
shattered one of them then what I don't
know here I'll do that cuz I really
don't know okay what do you want here
nice no wait there for me I did it right
I think I need to take this yellow just
because it fits here just because yeah
just because it's as long as I can fit
something in there I'm gonna do it
without this is where I can't believe
stuff around no can they do have two
more tool moves to make should i I can't
do the three though right it's what I
really needed was here it was to do this
here and then put that there you know
I'm saying yep wow it's really not good
start on the back no are you and do this
if it's the only choice
okay can you place any of these legally
right I cannot three no one worry
three-one no no he cannot place any of
those illegal all right
it's either draw or switches my hey
let's do returned I to the back yes
before your dramatizing I mean I don't
know
well the purple is the best one in case
you draw it again because okay yeah cuz
no me go where that yellow red Ron white
square is just draw a blue Lincoln come
on
well purple you choose you get to memory
man
so purple five right here Yeah Yeah
right yeah that gets you that bonus
it doesn't wreck either the Rose and
it's doing places this I stuff to have
to to be able to place this that's why
I'm correct okay and big negate takes
the final oh yes yeah
hopefully I picked something good with
the fire with the Blues here and it's a
value I need it needs to be a four I
hope someone cut I really want you to do
they want to change out the track one so
okay what is that
so you drop your lens lands okay okay
and I take one of these and then down
the track yeah okay we'll put that on
there and take in this stream for or
okay
and then this goes here and here we go
last turn yeah blue five well I need a
one day no before yeah you need a blue
for man I need to do it thank you
okay yep
it has to be that yep 100% and I
think I need the blue five down what L
want to kill my place I'm gonna have I'm
gonna have holes window sir yeah that is
not cool is there a non purple three up
there not currently have it or not have
it a non red one
yes it is now on red one the green no
but it's green dude it repeats oh yeah
tell me about it okay nine red one non
red one for you I'm gonna I'm just gonna
bone it okay
I'm just placing whatever I can legally
place well there's no sixes that I
believe or no hang on
oh you have more stones you're right
nevermind she has no more no more stones
then yes place no nope illegal though
okay I was gonna say place oh wait is
that the only one you can place legally
these two those two if one of them is
your bonus color it gets you that many
points just FYI just reminding you of a
way to make some points pineapple is her
bonus colors that were merely purple or
blue it's yellow and she's gotten to
dice the whole game yeah I took the I
don't know red five the fire at five
standing by yeah cuz I can't place a
purple with you in so so she does not
take a second dot correct it just stays
in the tip stays there Dave choose okay
I'm not gonna think I'm gonna just do
this I'm gonna spend these two to go
here I'm gonna put this there done
here's your choices earrings oh it's me
already
none of those are legally placeable for
me but I can I believe takes something
from the track and a green to is
actually the perfect choice no a green
don't be the three no it is a 2 I almost
thought it was the brief but it's
actually because it's the reason only
thing I can use yep that would be
hilarious I feel bad but I would have to
do it you might have some it's actually
the two the two is what is okay right
for me right cuz this way is color yep
and this way isn't shade correct and
that's this boy we sure like this lens
cutter tool though
who'd saving our windows alright so I'm
gonna do the two on I guess this one
correct ignoring the shade and I just
mixed wanted to take one of these and
put it over there no you move one of
your dice normal yes to the where the
six is and then you take the green then
you take up oh no yellow 555 no it
doesn't know three three oh yeah yeah
okay three but I thought it was that
maybe it's this whatever the other one
the one that's lens it's right but the
one I need to take to make the three
from there you can't put the three on
the six this is the only thing that
allows you to put a different color
oh so hang on that's okay let's just
look where can you place a purple three
is the well what can go here anything
non ideally something yellow how about
the yellow three link nope
how about the yellow one link getting
yellow one go there none of those yellow
can move because then the a purple would
have to go next to no you can put it oh
we can put the yellow five put the l5
can the yellow one be lifted here yes
yeah that's where behind it I do not you
check that one oh it is okay
okay beautiful was this I was a to do so
move the one over so spend - yeah he's
over to go here I get it back you move
the one ignoring the shade restriction
or they cut the number restriction of
the shape of the capsule and then dump
the yellow five in there yeah yeah it's
pretty good
cuz that column was already messed up
anyway yeah oh no it's 240 I already
know then use and this column is good
yeah all the columns are good yeah that
worked out at least I got that bonus but
I spent two to do those you still only
Aaron's got an extra point live here you
you really need them it's tough
alright so yeah what would you do if you
didn't have that weird I happen I know
well what that's like expert mode play
with he not no change no tools just just
that doesn't really no perma I don't
know I just made it up but I would I'd
try it okay so here we go
I'm not gonna score we'll just take
these dice off this little thing how do
we scored remember all the numbers in
our head you flip it over
here's all of our colors except turn
these over so they've been on the fifty
side okay and then we'll start with you
this kind of player dad how many four
threes how many four threes do have I
have one two three four okay so eight
points for that it's nice color column
variety yes yes sorry yes dope to a
three three
alright so fifteen right one two three
four five ten and then this way I didn't
even try but I might yes take no no one
right four five mm-hmm one two three
four five and what was your bonus color
so you were really going for that didn't
work out every time you're free you're
free for pair okay so I have one two
three I think that's it okay for six
color column variety did you do all five
yeah yes 25 sep 30 one and then your
rose shade variety six one six two three
yep for 15 so one two three four five
team and then finally you're exciting my
Lolo oh I apologize
Nikki loses one point for her empty
space yeah you are blue mm-hmm that's a
10 18 21 21
all right one two three four hey we flip
over 51
eight nine ten eleven D 167 Aaron you
are wrong huh
okay I have three couples so six is that
the two three fours yeah okay
I believe I got all the rows the color
columns so 25 so 25 ok 31 yep
and I believe I got all 1 2 3 5 6 1 3 4
5 6 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 got 90 20 points
for the Rose so 51 yep and then your
exciting bonus color I'll take one point
yeah yeah yeah I wasn't gonna forget all
right yeah it's yellow unfortunately so
I got Wow look at those low yellow seven
Wow no no I know I just got that that's
what I got yeah Wow
yeah all right so for three fours well
let's see one two three I got three of
them so six for this I got one two three
four right I bone to this one
no I bought that one too so just three
one two three okay
so 15 one two three team I got that one
that one that one that one I got all of
those for 20 so 39 no stones my secret
color was a red and I got 12 plus 7 is
19 mmm not gonna be those 19 is back to
38 plus 20 is 58 boom yeah I came in
third nice okay you make a new one with
67 Aaron came in second with 63 I had 58
and Nicky had 37 well really yeah
because she's got a missing hole which
takes out a column and a row yeah she's
not hole smashed in her window it was a
it was not just kids so in the early
game while you guys were doing something
and I was looking over here and talking
Nikki I'm like well you know worst case
you can always just take a color that's
your thing and she's like well I'm like
oh my god is it green she said yes she
just wasn't getting she just never got
me I have seen people I have seen some
people feel of this I don't feel this
way but some people feel that this is
too strong I have seen people win this
game just with this like ignoring a lot
of these and just piling as many red as
sure because every red dye I place on my
board could potentially be six points
but you have to get them yeah as well as
the so with all my horrible
incident well yeah cuz you got
everything I mean you got almost
everything yeah that twenty-something
points off of that it's yeah that's
shocking though but I thought for sure I
wasn't gonna make it I was gonna be some
holes well it's a miracle that I was
able to rejigger it even Wow
even a hope I was a lard even a hole you
probably could have still done it
although Aaron was very close on your
tail yeah I thought he was gonna win I
bet you realize it was this it was this
is what got me I got I got 45 I got
every single room now I thought for sure
you had it I was like wondering what
your bonus was like once again of Ages
sort of I just I was hoping it was green
for you man yeah but any would have been
okay is there well you had blue but like
you know my blue wasn't wonderful I mean
it 21 is not it was not horrible I only
only divided by four so any other color
well not red I I just never got yellows
every time I came up it was a one that
needed to go into one slot the reason
why I chose it was it would force me to
place blue yeah but of course it's a
pain in the rear end to do it if it's
not coming up and they were not coming
up for me it was really bad I'm like
well why I really wish I hadn't done
this because I thought well at least
whatever it is if I can try to put them
high but anything I didn't even carries
for him to be blue because anyone holes
so what did you think I even though I
lost terribly I sigh I do like it I like
fiddling around with the dice and
they're just pretty yeah I know it's
silly but I just like the transparent
colors and you're playing within the
board and the arts all beautiful and I
do like that you have these
different goals every game and there's a
ton more of these right that you really
can choose and the tools are cool too
but they the tools I mean I used all my
gems I would have liked it to old it I
thought you're gonna have three left to
a team I thought you're gonna have I was
like why he's envision great change dad
I face or something like that right
awesome for me well again some tools are
hanging on the media well yellow would
have been bad for you as being your
bonus color as well what I think Wow one
three one three one yeah so I mentioned
this one already the that pliers running
pliers after your first turn immediately
drafted I so that's and your skip your
next one so if there's two things that
come up in your first or second you can
just get them right away
there's the counterpart to this where
you can move ignoring the color not the
not the shade of course there's
different kind of scoring the
counterparts of those the pair's are all
represented okay this is for every set
of one two three four five six
oh cool this is interesting so this
score is the number of diagonally
adjacent dice so in my board Green would
score three and red would score four Wow
write your score with disco and soar for
these two pairs of green I think so I
think it's just all color diagonals okay
so this is like blue would this be okay
then yeah that would be five miles yeah
cool yeah oh let's see here you go move
exactly two dice obeying all rules but
it's move exactly two dice yeah you
can't do one right you have to move to
after drafting you can reroll the die
you drafted ooh this one I've seen this
would come up to an humorous effect so
you can't do this on your first round of
drafting but on your second render
drafting you can we roll all the dice in
the draft pool oh yeah I like that too
that's a good mess with everything well
or help someone by acts
depending on you know now after drafting
place a die in a spot that is not
adjacent to another die so you can just
put it anywhere you're bored as long as
it's legal here's what you wanted you
can draft and then flip to the opposite
side yeah yeah or there's a similar
that's great
after you can drafting you can the
harshness increases you only survive I
don't like then having to pay to write
is I almost well I mean I you know but
it's harsh because it's like if
especially if you have an odd number
right it's good to give one now to get
one in there to get hours probably is
weird move up to two dice of the same
color but they have to match a color
that's on the round track right okay but
you can't but you can just move two dice
that or whatever color is either
presented early in the game that might
only be one or two colors available well
it's the up to you're not forced to have
exactly two so that's what we have also
I first like if like the first three
rounds there were green dice up there
yeah that's my thing I'm sure she was
purple I knew Dave was red because he
did the same thing I did
oh just take that one that's got the
yeah for crossing me stylin oh well Lane
again and you didn't get you read either
no I mean but you did scores no and none
of us I mean no one really hate draft
that I was you were never thinking I'll
take a read from Dave right no really I
tried to take something that I thought
might be useful for you guys down the
line but nice if I did not worry about
that at all but not specifically like I
know you need a red five right there
right I know people that that of course
take that into account which is
completely viable and I almost never do
just because this puzzle part is already
so much it's difficult but it does get
to the point where like when I'm putting
a die back in the bag or if I'm swapping
one to the board
I am potentially like maybe cursory
looking at you like oh if he needs that
maybe I'll move it yeah but other than
yeah oh that's about the level I'm at
also I really like the theme in this
game music for what's essentially a
fairly simple dice placement and
drafting game like the themes really
neat I mean yes the arts beautiful but
like just the fact that each of these
tools has a different specific name for
each of the tools and sort of
corresponds to what they do grossing
plier and the
half wheel and the copper foil burnisher
like they're all actual stained glass
window tools Corbin back straight edge
and yeah and like and the and you know
and this thing about the like the
different colors the the theme of the
different colors not going together and
stuff for a fairly simple game I think
it's actually it's way team heavy it's
awesome when I silicate it and I even if
they expect yeah yeah it's there's I was
just in terror
you know what's coming I thought this is
gonna be horrible I'm not gonna be able
to place well hey that's why you have
the stones it also be you could have
taken I mean I mean obviously that's why
they gave you five for this okay you
could get into that you can bump out of
that and that could be a strategy you
could take your color thing and you
could take a three you could take like
one of the easiest ones that has the
fewest whatever's and then you could
just try to pile up on your color you
know there's I have seen people get 30
plus points in color Wow which is crazy
right now but all you need is like three
sixes and three fives and you're already
at 33 points right there right I mean no
yeah
33 so it's not hard to do but again they
have to come up yeah now if there's any
late numbers that's even easier to get
more in your color again if they come up
I've never read the rules to the one
player game but there is a one another
game it's what these numbers are for on
the tops of the cards and also these car
I don't know how that works but there's
probably something I don't know I never
recommend them it's cool that there's a
lot more games nowadays that have solo
play in variants which is nice because a
lot of folks just you know don't have
the opportunity even get into game play
with writers well and if you can do it
if you can actually you're out wise ugly
yeah I mean I think ease has got like
the prettiest one of the bunch if she
could well the purple and I'm a doll
okay we got that as a scream at the end
you all verse five and minus five points
for prettiest and ugliest I do have
diagonal going though its yep all red
Lincoln's got like a W over there were
an emblem well that was this you know
that is icing which would have been cool
if we did that diagonal one there yeah
it's neat I mean but if you know that
going in right your placement becomes
very different and also your color
choices become crazily different yeah
yeah yeah well it's hard its caller
Michael
that would be very interesting yeah
because you you can probably still do
them but that would be tough huh
I like how those make that make it a
little different every time well if you
just did something like a V for each one
then you get five points because I think
five is about the most you're gonna get
know you could get seven yeah no see
yeah seven you can run one color like
all crazy do a square and then three
this way though that's a server of
course eight nine well assuming it's all
of them and again I'm not a hundred
percent sure but I believe it's all of
them I don't think it's like just the
blue like your biggest blue your biggest
a line I think it's all you could
do ten because there's 20 spots so you
could literally do tenon touch you
wouldn't need to do it - no I know but
you wouldn't meet your almost better off
doing you know five threes for 15 right
so nine seems like are you sure you can
do 10 diagonally sure one two three
oh no no no yeah three and two and three
and two
oh I see multiples I'm doing one color
right if you're going crazy with one cut
no you know are they had all the idea
diagonally touching three red we had two
rib and three red and two red but you
don't okay yeah interesting you don't
have it doesn't have to be a path
necessarily it's just a touch totally
totally Jason I do I would like to play
Melanie show it makes they show it as a
path but if there were a blue here as
well I believe that would be six points
well I'm diagonally adjacent Cinco yes
that's it neat yeah that would be a fun
one yeah it'd be hard though and we'd
all be doing we have to choose another
color you couldn't do too much of the
same or you could just blow it off
especially if you're going for ten I
mean for example I for example I wasn't
going for that this game right I was
just doing what I got and if we were
scoring that card I'd have one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
Wow just ten but I'd have ten I mean I
wouldn't out score you guys probably but
I would still have ten I only have eight
just from Ray my advice my one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen thirteen yeah no
I have eleven okay are you doing just
count them two three four five six seven
eight nine
eleven oh I would do that one twelve
twelve thirteen yeah so fourteen fifteen
did I get that one out I think so one
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
mr. Niki has 15 yeah we didn't even talk
about trying and she's missing a die
yeah a purple or what couldn't be a red
but a purple there would have been would
give her one yeah yeah cool
well thanks for teachers Dave you're
welcome

welcome thank you for joining me grade
board game we're here with the unboxing
of my latest Kickstarter fulfillment
sagrada from floodgate games let's get
the plastic off get this box open and
see what's inside
got the plastic off see if we can get
the top off now Oh sounds like it's
slide nice and easy see what we have
inside the box it looks like a pretty
simple to follow rulebook because that
is it just four pages front to back I
like the way that looks nothing rule
heavy one we got some cardboard the
colors on this great
it's sticking car was sticking together
a little bit there
I haven't watched any videos on gameplay
yes I do not know what each of these is
for these player boards
those are didn't get to focus there we
go
see those are quite thick you got these
open windows so you're gonna have to
slide some cards in there I like the way
those are set up those are sturdy
there's really good material on those we
got the four different player boards at
the Kickstarter exclusive board again
the colors and the details and all of
these are great I know my my wife has
had her interest piqued by this one she
was one of her degrees as a degree in
fine arts so she was intrigued when she
saw me opening this up and here are the
cards we get the plastic off of these
those were tricky to get the plastic off
because it was vacuumed on there tight
there was not a loose corner anywhere so
I had to be real careful not to damage
the cards because they're not a real
heavy cardstock but they really don't
have to be because judging by what I saw
on here these are going to slide into
the player cards there we go
and they don't need to be sturdy because
they're insighting really thick sturdy
player boards so those get in there nice
everything looks like it lines up great
so the printing was done printing
alignment was done properly several
different cards so lots of different
ways
to complete it I have a couple of
cardboard tokens here and these look
like the score tokens for the different
players one side just the regular color
and then 50 then there's a Kickstarter
players token I have a box of plain
clear our bag of plain clear glass beads
we have another another deck of cards
and the like Gaudi Cathedral these cards
had a loose corner on them so they were
a little bit easier to open not sure of
course
what they're for because I haven't
played the game yet or watched any
videos on it but the cart design now
these cards the dolt slide in appear to
be a well maybe not maybe they are the
same kind of stock now they feel a
little bit heavier I might just be
fooled because they're a smaller card
but they feel to be a little more sturdy
since they're not going to be slid
inside a dense player board and we have
a small bag a large bag and a whole
bunch of dice which
not the main selling point to me I
enjoyed seeing a different kind of theme
there but hey you're gonna get me when
you give me a huge bag of multi colored
translucent dice and I believe that's it
unless there's something hiding
underneath the plastic inserts which
there is not there we go that is the
unboxing I'm gonna get that back in
there without breaking it there we have

hey everybody welcome back to watch it
played my name is rodney smith and this
is pat mcdonald and we're here to begin
our playthrough of sagrada glass panes
of the 13th century yes the subtitle if
you had totally had me for a second I'm
like that sounds pretty good so close so
close yes that we've we've done
everything I think we've we've gone to
Mars we've built incredible artistic
galleries we have fought as fancy heroes
and now we're making stained-glass
windows yeah I didn't expect this theme
listen anyone who thinks ah there's not
a theme up there for me I beg to differ
there's a theme for everything right
that's gotta be thing for everything
pretty much isn't this time we're gonna
be building these beautiful
stained-glass windows if you don't know
how to play sagrada we do have a
tutorial video fourth you can check out
we're a link to that in the description
of this video and i thought this would
be a nice way to do pet because it's
gonna be kind of quick and i know you're
feeling a little under the weather
people might not realize but you can buy
a little bit of a cold that's why i
picked green today boogers really we're
making a booger joke here yeah and i'm
blue
but i'm feeling good it's not has none
to do with my feeling you know I'm
feeling really pretty happy about this
I'm looking forward to this only also I
should mention did pre pick out our
pains oh yes you get dealt two of these
with double side you pick the one you
want choose your pain my pain might be
painful it's one of the more complicated
one has five of the dots what about you
I mean yeah I picked a five dot as well
okay so we're even-steven there we also
have our private objectives already
dealt or see mine no we're not allowed
to look at each other's and we also have
the the public objectives and the tools
that we can use so maybe we should go to
the table and just show everyone what
we've got yeah let's do it all right the
first one we have here is called color
diagonals and you'll get one point for
every windowpane you have that is
diagonally adjacent to another matching
colored windowpane next up is medium
shades now that's gonna give you two
points for every set of three and four
in your window and finally we have
Collin color variety and this is gonna
give you five points for every column
where you don't have colors repeating
within it and what if the column isn't
actually filled like you only have three
dice in there oh that's a good question
if the column isn't filled then you
can't score it for choice of tools we've
got flux brush which after you draft it
lets you reroll the drafted
now if you can't place it you just have
to throw it back in the pool the next
one's called cork back straight edge and
this allows you after you've drafted to
die to put it anywhere within your
windowpane following the normal rules
except it does not have to be adjacent
to other dice you've already placed and
next up is lens cutter now this one's
neat because after you draft you can
swap the die that you drafted with one
from the round track
well pepp you might not like this but
the way the game recommends that you
picked the first player is to have the
person who most recently visited
Cathedral go first oh that's definitely
it is I was just in Germany recently and
I got to see a whole bunch of amazing
cathedrals and they had incredible
stained glass windows in fact I feel
like I might have a slight advantage
here I have recent inspiration to draw
from that you don't have I am fantastic
with colors though so you're colorblind
I don't like it I forgot about that this
could be very interesting for you okay
so as the first player I have a bag full
of dice here and I have to draw five out
which we will then roll into the dice
tray oh one thing I should mention
before we continue is that this dice
trade doesn't actually come with the
game well you stole this no path I
didn't steal it - this is a promo item
you can pick up from floodgate games
actually this entire window pane here is
also one of the promo ones it's very
pretty
well thank you and there's nothing
particularly unique about it you
certainly don't need either these items
to play the game but they are kind of
nice little upgrades so now Pat as the
first player I will get the first pick
of the dice here that have been rolled
and I think I will choose this blue one
right here and I'll slot it into the
position here on the edge now remember
your first eye has to go in one of the
spaces on the outside edge and I matched
my blue dye to a blue space
now on this two-player game perhaps
gonna get to take the next two dice and
then I'll get the last choice this is
amazing so first up I'm gonna take this
red die and place it here well I think
you might have made a tragic mistake
there yes yes you're right I mean I want
to place it here okay that's good
because if you put the five here the
only guy that can go here is a five and
you can't put fives next to each other
that was a close one
so what do you wanna do for your second
die the next one I'm going to place this
purple one right here alright well from
my pick I'm gonna take this green one
and plop it here in the bottom corner
and the last I will go here on our round
track and that's one round down
alright well prep gets to be the active
player now so he draws the dice let's do
it you get first choice here Peck what
do you think well I cannot resist the
majesty of this other purple diet that
all
right into here and this raises a good
little rule point remember you cannot
have dice adjacent to each other that
are the same color or the same number
but that does not count diagonally so
those are fine well for my first pick
I'm gonna grab this green six and slide
it right into that position
for my second pick I'm gonna grab this
blue three and place it there right and
I have to go last so I'll just take this
yellow five and don't stick it right
there which ends the round making Rodney
the active player so far my windowpanes
kind of boring only two colors in there
you've got three colors going I gotta
brighten things up all right so this is
my chance to add a little bit of color
I'm gonna take the yellow five and place
it here on the space looking for or five
it's always rough being the first player
knowing that you're gonna get two dice
back-to-back and one of them I
especially love I'm gonna take this
purple four and slide it right into
their and also grab this blue two it'll
put right here your stained glass window
is Bluetooth you're ridiculous
maybe a little bit I'm going to take
this dye here the one and I'll place it
in this space that requires a one that
will end my turn and it will also end
the round so this will go here
alright pep this means you get to go
next well I hate to break it to you but
this means you will not get to place
another purple for this round ah darn it
your streak has been broken
alright then instead I'll take this red
one I'll just put it over here all right
so my first pick will be this red four
I'm gonna place it here in the space
that requires a four and then I think
I'll take this blue four and I will
place it here I'm very methodically just
filling in the bottom if I windowpane
very organized in my method I noticed
that I'm a lot more sporadic if you're
all over the place I gotta try to get
this corner over here filled in so I'm
gonna take this green one and then that
will end the round alright well we're
moving right along here and it's my turn
to roll the dice which means I also get
first pick I'm have to break my find
pattern here and instead I'm gonna place
one out of line at the bottom up here is
a purple three oh you took my purple is
that what you wanted I did
well I'd left you with some other
options there I'm sure you'll find
something you like and don't forget you
also have the ability to use these tools
and potentially grab one of the dice
that are up here at the top I must say
I'm green with envy at your pains so I'm
gonna take this green and place it here
and then I'm gonna take horrifying pun
this green place
okay we'll have a little jealous of your
high technology windows so I'm gonna
install some Bluetooth into mine as well
which will end this round and move us on
to the sixth round all right now it's
time for me to roll well there is a
purple one sitting there if you wanna
know that's a purple to know we're going
to end this soon well before we do I
need to actually take this blue three
and place it right there you know I
think we have reached sort of a critical
level of puns in this episode already I
think we should stop here and what we'll
do is we'll let the audience make the
choice what what to dice I should pick
next it stick around until the end of
this video because we'll give you a
quick overview of the different
components here to help you make an
informed decision about what I should be
doing for my turn and I'll also give you
a sneak peek at my private objective and
don't forget there are some tool cards
you can use as well perhaps to smash
Roz's windows don't smash languages I
want you to help me make my windows
better give me your suggestions in the
comments below and if you like what
someone says give them a thumbs up if
you don't like it propose your own
suggestion maybe that will get the most
votes which everyone does
that's what come back and do but until
the next episode thanks for watching

[Music]
and now it's time for another Dice Tower
review with Tom
vassel hey folks sometimes you see a
game that makes you just stop and look
at it and I believe that's the case of
Sagrada this is a really beautiful cover
it's a game about making those beautiful
stained glass windows in cathedrals and
again this is one of the times where I
applaud in a sense because I like this
theme but what makes the seem even
cooler is it's using piles of colorful
dice beautiful dice they're really nice
Dice and you're going to be drafting
these Dice and building your own stained
glass window now the theme isn't that
strong right it's just about placing
dice it's a drafting dice game where
you're taking Dice and trying to place
them inside your window matching numbers
matching colors trying to get the
highest score that you possibly can
let's take a
[Music]
[Applause]
look each player is going to get one of
these starting boards and they're
different colors and they're beautiful
they don't really matter though what
matters is players are going to get
these cards and you're going to decide
which side of the card to use and the
cards have different values But
whichever side you use so for example
this side has a value of six this side
has a value of four this one is easier
than this one however if I use this one
I will get six favor tokens as opposed
to four if I only use this one whichever
one you do decide to use you're going to
stick it so that it pulls up into your
and you can see the different spots here
some have colors and some have numbers
each player is going to be given a
secret objective card which shows what
color is worth more to them so you know
that you're going to be going for a
specific color there's going to be some
public objective cards that are placed
here and these are going to score points
at the end of the game so for example
here you get six points for each row
that has no repeated colors so one of
every color in a row this one here you
get two points for every set of three
and four you can find in your thing and
this one here count all diagonally
adjacent same color dice so here you can
see these dice are are adjacent to each
other diagonally you're also going to
have some tool cards placed out these
tool cards going to be cards that
players can use on their turn to do
various things uh to kind of manipulate
your dice so you saw on the drop there's
a lot of dice in this game there's
actually 90 dice here and so each round
of the game one player is going to pull
Dice from the bag so let's say it's a
three player game you're going to pull
seven how do I know it's seven well two
times the number of players plus uh one
for one extra one so here we have our
seven dice that person will roll those
dice those dice will be placed where
everyone can see it and then the start
player is going to draft one of these
dice they're going to take one dice and
place it in their Cathedral or they can
pass and just get rid of it um then the
second player will take one then the
third player then the third player takes
another one then the second player then
the first player and then the last gu
you put here and this helps keep track
of the rounds of the game you also on
your uh turn have a opportunity to use
one of these tools you can use your
favor tokens that you have they'll be on
your window here when you put a a tool
when you use a tool the first person use
it only pays one the next person use it
pays two etc etc keeping these are worth
points at the end of the game so you
only want to use a tool when it's really
important and will help you out as you
can see this one here says after
drafting flip it to the opposite side
that can be prettyy handy or roll dice
in a draft pole um or here move anyone
down your window ignoring the color
restrictions speaking of color
restrictions let's take a closer look
here at the window when placing dice the
first die has to go somewhere on the
outside so maybe I want to place this
die here a five purple now whenever you
place a die if in the future it has to
go next to this die so when you go next
to this die so I can see I can go here
or here there will be restriction in
some of the spots so for example here
there's no restriction it can be
anything except it can't be a purple and
it can't be a five because you can never
have two of the same color next to each
other or two of the same number next to
each other so this six red could
legitimately fit there this blue four
can go here next to the six because this
has to be a four it doesn't matter what
color it is it just has to be a four and
then next to that you can see it could
be a three but it can't be this blue
three why because this is a blue here
this is a red it doesn't matter what
number it is as long as it's a red
although again a red four won't fit
there because there is a four there but
I could put this red six there and
that's fine and then maybe a purple five
would go here and then a purple three is
going to go here so you're going to try
to fill this in as much as you possibly
can once 10 turns have gone by everyone
is then going to take each of the public
objective cards and see if they can
score for them so let's say for example
I
had well not the let's say this was my
bottom row you can see there's one of
every color in that bottom row and that
gives me a bonus of six points if I was
going for purple I would be doing pretty
well because I'm going to get the sum of
all the values on purple dice so that's
13 on the purple Dice and let me look
here this hopefully this would not be my
ending position because I would
hopefully have filled in more spots
every three and four so here's a three
and four there's a three and four
there's a three but no matching four so
I have two sets so I get another four
points and then this one says count
diagonal adjacent of the same color so
the number so here I have two purples
next to each other diagonally that's it
so that's another two points for this
one and then you add up your points the
way you're going to add up points is
you're going to take this which was used
to keep track of the rounds you flip it
over and each player puts a score marker
on it and keeps track of their points
most points is the
[Music]
winner so I already production the
production in this game is just gorgeous
from the stained glass windows to once
it's full of dice it looks good to the
cards are high quality to the Box you
have a nice bag for the dice the whole
thing just is like wooo and when people
walk by they're like what are you
playing so that's good the game itself
is also a simple game I don't mean that
it's simple as and simplistic it's it's
easy to play but there's a lot of you
know different things going on but what
I mean is it's like hey take a die put
it next to the dice you already match
the numbers and the colors or don't
match the numbers and the colors but
match them to your grid and that's
pretty easy for people to understand if
there's any confusion with the game it
would come probably from the tool cards
and knowing when to use them because
it's kind of a odd concept okay the
first person to use it it's cheaper but
if you use it early I mean you might as
well use it early on your turn you can
draft one die or you must draft one die
or discard it and then you can use a
tool and using tools early is great but
the problem is you don't need them as
much early you'll need them way more as
time goes by because your grid is
starting to fill and you're like okay
for this spot I need a blue three or a
red three only two ones that will fit
here and sometimes I need a blue three
well the chance of a blue three being
rolled isn't very high but maybe with
those tools you can manipulate it
however other people have used those
tools so you might be down to just a few
of these favor tokens left and that's a
good mechanism and that might be the
only thing that would trip off new
people as they come in uh but other than
that the drafting of the dice is a
pretty simple thing and you're going to
put it there so that's really the fun of
the game the game is a simple one this
could be nominated for shars honestly
that's that that's the style of this
game I don't know if it can be because I
don't know if it was produced in Germany
but I'm saying it feels that way this
feels like a a Gateway game a game you
can say hey sit down let's just play a
game we're going to pull dice we're
going to roll dice we're going to draft
these dice put them in here going to
build a beautiful sang glass window and
that's great it's a it's it's a game
with a hook uh it's fun and easy to get
into you can decide whether to build a
harder window or an easier window you're
going to sit there and try to match the
goals on the table match the goal in
your hand so every that it comes out
you're like hm which day should I take
but it's not too long we're talking 30
45 minutes it it scales well plays two
three or four players I wonder I wonder
why they didn't add the fifth player but
you know either way it it's it's good
now it's going to be compared to other
dice drafting games there isn't many of
them the one that came out last year is
role player and I've actually had a
chance to play this and role player back
to back and I think role player is a
better game there's more involved but I
can see myself bringing this one out
just as much because first of all the
theme of this is going to appeal to a
lot of people role player is a great
theme but it's going to appeal to people
who want to build characters and
Dungeons and Dragons this will appeal to
anybody this is a game that I could
bring in my family and they would like
it um also this one is just a
wonderfully gorgeous production and it's
simple and easy to teach so if you're
looking for something that's different
theme-wise that looks great on the table
but is also interesting and easy to play
but offers some pretty devious choices
sometimes she'll sit there and go you
want to be the first person to draft
which means when you're then you're the
last one to draft so you're picking
between two dice or if you're the third
or fourth person to draft it's not so
bad because you're going to get two dice
in a row I like that concept it works
well certainly a game to check out and
it like it feels like a breath of fresh
it's like yeah this is the kind of game
publisher should be making good job on

hi everybody welcome to another episode
of bored to death Felicia can be here
today so I will be flying solo for now
she will be back though uh this is our
review of
Sagrada players take on the role of
artists creating the most beautiful
stained glass window in sagata at the
end of the 10th round the player with
the most points wins the game here is
set for three players each player will
start with a window frame and the
matching score tracker Shuffle the
private objective cards and deal one to
each player then Shuffle the window
pattern cards and deal two to each
player they'll choose one of them by
looking at both sides and place the
chosen one into their window frame the
bottom will show you the difficulty
level the more dots you have the harder
each player will then receive favor
tokens equal to those dots place the
score track on the opposite side to the
round track Shuffle the public objective
cards and reveal three do the same for
the tool cards all the dice go in the
bag determine a first player and you're
ready to play the first player on each
round will draw a number of dice equal
to two per player plus one in this case
seven and roll them she'll draft or take
a die and place it on her board now
there are a couple of rules to follow on
the first round the die must be placed
on a side or Corner space then these
rules will apply you must always place a
die adjacent to one you already placed
diagonally included now orthogonally you
cannot place the same color or number as
the one there diagonally this rule does
not apply next each space might require
you to have to play color or shade the
number as specified this is quite easy
at the beginning but in later rounds
becomes hard hard to do once the first
player drafted a die the next player in
clockwise order does the same and so
forth except the last player will do two
consecutive turns he'll draft a die
place it then takes another turn then
play proceeds counterclockwise until we
reach the first player again will she'll
draft a second die it is possible
especially at the end game where you
cannot draft the dock because you can't
place it due to restrictions in this
case you can simply not draft a die but
be aware that as soon as you do this you
won't be able to complete your window as
the spaces are counted exactly for you
to take two diap per round when everyone
drafted two dice there will be one or
more dice remaining in the draft pool
take one and place it on the current
round space placing any extra on top
then the player on the left of the first
will become first player for the next
round we personally use the master AR
Artisan card to denote the change on
your turn sometimes specified by the
tool cards in terms of either after or
before you may want to use the available
Community tools to do so you'll need to
spend your favor tokens if it's the
first time a tool card is being used
meaning there are no favor tokens on it
you'll need to spend one by placing it
on the card to use the Ability if there
are already favor tokens on it you'll
need to spend two now consider using
these tools carefully as each favor
token will be worth one point at the end
of the game
scoring speaking of endgame scoring
besides your private go card keep in
mind the public go cards as well these
can be row or columns related
positioning sets repetition or lack of
etc etc at the end of the 10th round
players will count their points remove
the dice from the round tracker and flip
it over first count the shade total of
your private objective and place your
score track on the corresponding space
then check for each public objective
cards you'll gain this amount of points
per objective on the cards so yes it's
possible to gain
multiples then count one point for favor
token remaining flip the token to the 50
side if going over lastly any empty
space not filled will Garen you a minus
onepoint penalty total all these up and
the player with the most points wins
sagata is an excellent game that is
quite addictive especially since the
games are just the right length as you
can see the artwork is stunning and
iconography is spoton and the sturdy
components from the player boards to
even the Box insert complement the
artwork I love how anyone can pick up
this game fairly quickly yet it has some
depth to it making it accessible to all
Gamers what's great for competitive
players is how you can affect both
players to your left and right as the
draft goes clockwise wi and
counterclockwise however there's no real
way of affecting the fourth player out
of your reach but this is a very very
small con for only a half a point
penalty luck is extremely well handled
and there are many mitigation tools
literally and with so much variety
between them and the public goals and
the solo mode replay value is definitely
a pro on this one now speaking of
balance and the tools we did find that
there is a little error in the final
score T an empty space will only incur
you a minus one penalty so sometimes not
using two favor tokens to finish off
your window might be to your advantage
especially if it won't complete either
of your private or public goal and why
lose two points when you can only lose
one we felt at least a minus two penalty
per space at the minimum was needed but
again this was rectifiable and it's just
a preference on our part so I'm only
giving it a half Point penalty in the
end the cons being so small and the game
being a genuine work of art we give
sigada a whopping nine out of
10 subscribe now to our channel to stay

TRANSCRIPCIÓN:
hi everyone I'm Tom today I'm going to
be playing Sagrada this is a dice
drafting game all about building
stained-glass windows and that's what
these lovely player boards are
simulating here these are the windows
we're going to be using at the start of
the game you'll have your choice of two
double sided window cards I have just
gone ahead and picked some already you
also get a personal objective which will
be a color of dice so Marty who is
actually off camera right now he can sit
on his window there he is after a yellow
shades he's gonna get a point at that at
the end of the game for every pip on
yellow Daleks in his window and he wants
some yellows in his thing that's partly
why I picked that I want some blue as
well I didn't have any with loads of
blue in it so I've got some here though
I should be okay in around a Sagrada the
first player which will be me to start
with has the dice back and they will
draw some dots from it in a two-player
game you draw five dots and then roll
the dice this is an interesting dilemma
I haven't really left space for the dice
over so we have these dice available a
lot of yellow which is good for Marty
isn't it actually although low numbers
so not perfect now I will take the first
one then Marty will take one then Marty
again then back to me and it will switch
for each round as we pass the bag across
but that is basically the game you're
gonna pick one of these stocks your
first dice has to start in a corner or
an edge of your window so I am going to
I want blue so I want to make sure I've
got this and since I'm probably gonna
end up with a yellow later either if
these corners is fine I think I'm gonna
start over here now our restrictions in
the future are well you see these spaces
that have colors you have to put that
color there restrictions with the
numbers they have to have that number
there but in the future you cannot put
an identical color next to each other
orthogonal E or and I did identical
number which is the shade the numbers of
the shades in this game so you can you
can spread out adjacent diagonally as
well as orthogonal E but you have to be
aware of that so if I put anything five
there I'm not gonna be able to put it in
this but
that desperately needs one so you really
have to bear that in mind since there's
yellows are for right away Marty's just
gonna go for them oh we should pay
attention as well to these that are out
here these public objectives so we saw
our private ones to have these colors
there are also these public objectives
which at the end of the game we're going
to get six points for every row we have
that's complete and has no repeated
colors and then two points for each set
of threes and fours or five and six so I
have a four already so Marty definitely
wants to make sure he's got that three
there that yellow three and he's just
gonna place that up in this corner here
and the next one that he's gonna take is
not gonna be another yellow it's gonna
be a six because it's partly to do with
that but also if he'd placed it down
here he would have to put the red off
somewhere because if he put it there he
couldn't put a six in that corner
whereas here he's fit he's not filling
up the colors but he's filling up the
numbers okay we'll see though if enough
things come out to justify I'm doing
that later on so now there is just two
available I can use these tools as well
on my turn I can use one of the tools
the cost is a favor token now when we
picked our windows they have different
difficulties on them Marty's had five
mine had four so Marty's was more
difficult he gets more favor tokens it
costs a favor token to use any of these
if it's empty if anybody else has used
it previously it's gonna cost you two to
use it and they will do different things
like after drafting you can return the
dice of the bag and pull a new one out
to choose the value on it and put it
somewhere in your thing or put it in the
draft pool if you're trying to deny
somebody something after drafting
re-roll the die if it still can't
replace predict back in the draft pool
and move exactly two dogs obeying
placement restrictions so if I had if
Marty had messed himself up here by
putting over red six there he could move
it later with that laid Caen so my last
pick I am just getting one of these twos
I'm not gonna use any powers and the
remaining one goes on the RAM counter
here there's ten rounds so that shows us
that the first one is done so it's
Marty's turn he is gonna pick five dice
out and roll them and so we've got red
six purple six Green five yellow -
yellow one so a lot of yellows
but they're not really you know they're
not really high numbers for him in
keeping with the sexes he doesn't want
another red on this row anywhere but
he's gonna take this red six and he's
gonna place it there because maybe if
the green fives left he can take that
and put it in this corner here and it's
another six so he know he's got a set of
five and sixes so he's got you know a
set of six so that's two points at the
end of the game for me so I could take
two in a row now
and unfortunately for Marty that five is
looking really nice for me either there
or in my green space I think I'm gonna
take this green five and I'm gonna place
it here on this five space and then I'm
just gonna go for the six then I've got
sets of fives and sixes let's go let's
go towards this corner this corner
doesn't care about Purple's it means I
can't put a six in any of these spaces
now there and we come back to Marty he
oh he it's got a bit of a dilemma
actually because if he takes so this to
here is okay but if he wants to put that
yellow there in the future he is going
to lose his row color bonus he could use
a favor token does he want to I think
he's going to try it he's gonna use a
favor token he's gonna put this back in
the bag as long as it's not a yellow
he's okay it's a blue so now he gets to
choose the value and place it I think he
is going to choose four he's gonna
choose four and just put it up here
keeping the row variety and four is good
for medium shades as well so this is the
one that got left over that goes up
there and I am the first player again so
we need five dice one two three four
five and we roll them so what have we
got red 3 red 2 blue five green five
purple five I've just noticed that this
great idea of mine has put a green there
when I need a green there so we'll see
how that goes in the future maybe I'll
move that I'm going to take
this green 5 though is my first one and
I'm gonna put it actually I'm gonna take
the blue 5 because I want blues data for
my personal goal I'm gonna take the blue
5 and I'm gonna put it over here as long
as it stays a 5 now Marty he wants fives
he'd be very happy with fives
I think he's gonna just take this he
knows greens okay for me so he's going
to take that green 5 away and put it in
this corner here then he can take
something else but it's gonna have to be
the purple 5 I think because he can't
put Reds in any of these spaces and he
can't really yeah maybe he should put it
out here so he can start spreading out
yeah he'll place that there and then
it's to me I will take the 3 since that
counts for the medium shade and I can
just put it in my red spot there and
that's the end of another round Marty is
first again so he needs 5 dice and he is
going to sort of forgot he's got yellow
for green for purple to green to blue 5
so I think it makes sense for him first
to take this yellow for since he wants
yellows and that can just go down here
doesn't really matter because he doesn't
know that I've got that blue objective
so he wouldn't be trying to deny them
for me I think I'm gonna take this blue
5 and put it there it's ok to go there
and then I'm gonna take this green too I
think
and place it down there and now we are
back to Marty he are this a shame that
that's that's right next to there where
he's already put a purple he is gonna
take the green where shall he put it
it's a 4 so it comes as a medium shade
so that's okay he could put it up here
and start building in there or maybe he
just wants to put it in one of these
spaces I think he's going to put it
there so then he's got access to a few
more spaces as well and that is the
around four so I'm first again we're at
around five two three four five and
we're after blues we've got one blue
there so that's probably what I'm gonna
be taking if I can put it somewhere so
we've got a lot of reds so it's a blue
fire there's no particularly good place
for it but it could actually it can't go
there because of that Green five so
unless we want it rear old which are
dumb up I'm not that bothered so what
could we put out we could put out a six
and just have you know more towards the
deep shades I'm gonna grab this red six
and I think we'll put it up there
because if this red ones love the red
one couldn't go there then cut it what
if we took the purple five then the red
one could go there because it's okay
because it's diagonal it's not
orthogonal so we're allowed to have the
same number there okay and it's rows we
want different not columns so it's okay
that the Purple's are there Marty
no he's after Reds so I couldn't have
taken him away from him anyway so he
doesn't want to use the six I think he's
just gonna grab the two and the one and
fill those up or is he no I don't think
he is I've put a red there as well and
he's gonna have to put a red there you
do lose points at the end of the game as
well for having empty spaces he's gonna
he's gonna do this so he needs to move a
dice as well then it comes back to me I
don't want to place that so it's gonna
be have to be a six so the six can
either go up here or on the top let's
just place it down there and then we've
got that left over sometimes you can
take some things off here and they used
in the solo game as well so there is a
point to having these stars on as well
as tracking the rounds Marty's first he
needs one two three four five dice and a
lot of blue and red but low numbers in
the blue so it's okay
from our see anyway okay so he what does
he really wants he really wants yellows
but also twos and ones work out quite
nicely he's gonna grab this red five and
he's gonna place it but they're in that
five spot I could grab this for and it
could go up there in that four spot and
then either if these ones is okay and
might as well be the blow now if I take
the blue one I've already got a blue up
there so I think we'll take the blue two
and we'll put that on here I haven't got
a blue on this row yet I might end up
you know destroying that one of the rows
I'm sure you can't get all of them you'd
have to be very lucky to get all of them
as for Marty he wants one of these ones
and it can't be blue because it's
already a blue there so he'll take a
purple back to me lean first player we
need five dice and what do we get a lot
of yellow and green Marty we'll be
taking that yellow I think I flipped
that from a six
hopefully it's a six now anyway so I
could take this green too
and place it over there or I could take
this yellow three let's take the green
now we do want to think about what else
we're going to move if we want to use
this this to move a dice because we
don't want to greens we want this green
move it over there but you have to move
two dice Marty he can't take both of
these yellows which is good for me so
he'll take one and put it there and he
can actually take that green six and put
it in his corner space there and for me
I could just take this yellow for it
suits me fine and I can go in my yellow
space okay then
Marty again he's got five dice and
there's some good yellows there a yellow
six is perfect I think that's what he's
gonna take right yellow six in that
yellow spot there and for me I would
like a one in there so the green would
suit me yeah let's just do this I am
going to put this there let's say and
then I'm going to use a tool so I am
going to move this to there because it's
okay it's okay the restrictions and this
there so now we're sorted there's only
one green on each row and I can take
this yellow five sorry Marty and fill up
the five gap that I just made so I think
we're okay four rows again there Marty
he he can't put that green two in there
so he can either put the purple there
with a green there the Purple's are
three so he'd rather take the three but
it's really restricting what can go in
that two spot isn't it let's see I'm
first again one two three four five and
some brilliant blues but I've already
got I'm really full on blues see is it
worth giving up this because I'd get a
point for each pip if I could just I
could just fill spaces with blues
there's no threes to put there let's see
four here I couldn't put a five or six
or a three I could put a four there but
I've already got a yellow up here I
couldn't use a 5 or a 4 so it could be a
six I've already got those I need a
purple on there up here I need a red and
it can be a six so little except I'm
gonna take this red six
Marty is gonna grab this no he was gonna
grab that yellow six but he can't he can
have the purple six there the blue six
there that fits fine and then this
yellow for fits there he already got six
is blocking off taking a six I think
that's okay this last rounds gonna be
very very restrictive indeed and for me
I can not take this
five at all I can take the yellow it
would love it if it was a three though
is it worth spending two of these at one
of these to re-roll it and try and make
it a three it's a point if it's a three
it'll be so perfectly let's try see that
seems fake doesn't it there was no cut
there I'll make sure not to cut around
that although I suppose I could have
filmed the entire game every time until
I rolled a three anyway so that goes up
there and it's time for the very last
round one two three four five here we go
okay then so it's Marty first he wants a
- it can't be green can be blue there we
go that's fine then for me I see green
can't go that a purple is the only thing
that can go there it can't be a five a
three it's just fine and what color do I
need down here purple again but it can't
be five do I spend two points as long as
I don't roll a five a six or a three I
can put that purple there or do I just
because it's giving up six points and I
can't put one there let's go for it so
it can't be I want anything but six five
or three on this purple then it's a five
so still can't take it it goes back to
the pool which means I have to take this
and just give up on the Robo and a stand
there Marty cannot take either of those
dice but as long as he pulls out a red
or a blue from there he's going to use
the flux remover again or could he if he
could move some dice around yeah he
could pay to move dice so let's move
this one here and this one here does
that still all work out I think that's
still all okay
take the purple but he can take the blue
and there we go
so that is the end of the game so the
first thing we do is score all of this
can go away now slid away isn't it fancy
using a tripod and then we can score our
personal objective so Marty four shades
of yellow so he gets three nine twelve
sixteen twenty points from his yellows
and me for my Blues I don't think I took
many five ten fourteen sixteen so not
too far behind then the public
objectives so row color variety so that
is not one that is one that isn't that
is no no that's got two greens are
really ruined Marty's there so he gets
six points for that this could be the
end of the competition here I have got 1
2 3 so that is 18 points so it's 34 then
favor tokens Marty's got to favor tokens
left and you lose a point for every
spare space no I'm not doing all of the
objectives calm down so threes and fours
so for each set of three and four so
let's we can take them off now it
doesn't matter where they are so take a
good look at the lovely windows and
let's see we've got a set of 3 and 4 3 &
4 3 & 4
I think that's all of his sets yeah he's
got no more three so that's 2 4 6 points
and then four fives and sixes he's got
one two three four sets so that is eight
points so 42 so hopefully I don't get
many points from these threes and fours
let's see we've got one set there
another set there so I've got three
there so that's six and then fives and
sixes I've got one two three sets
okay then so that's six more points so
closer than closer than it was earlier
so 42 to 46 of the final score I've just
managed to get a bit of a nicer window
than Marty but that is sagrada if you'd
like to know what I think then you can
click on the link on the screen there
but thank you very much for watching and
I'll see you for the next game bye
everyone

TRANSCRIPCIÓN:
hola y bienvenidos a un nuevo episodio
jugando con kate y hoy les explicaré
cómo se juega sagrada
sagrada es un juego en el cual vamos a
lanzar dados robarlos por turnos y
colocarlos en nuestro vitral de la
sagrada familia durante la preparación
lo que haremos será entregar una carta
de reverso gris a cada jugador que
determinará un color de dado que le dará
puntos de victoria al final de la
partida esto se mantiene oculto igual
que el carta sobrante sale del juego
además vamos a arreglar tres cartas de
poderes especiales y sacaremos el resto
de la partida y tres cartas de objetivos
comunes y sacaremos el resto de la
partida colocaremos este tablero de
rondas por el lado de las rondas boca
arriba el de puntuación se ocupará al
final de la partida las fichas de
puntuación a un costado y además cada
jugador va a recibir dos de estas
tarjetas débito estas tarjetas de litro
son reversibles entonces cada jugador
deberá escoger un lado de ellas y
colocarlo dentro de su vitro como pueden
ver aquí yo ya coloqué tres tarjetas uno
en cada vitro
y deja a la vista esto que ven acá esto
que ven acá es el nivel de dificultad
del vitral entonces en este caso tiene
una dificultad de 3 y el jugador para
recibir tres fichas de favor está acá
tiene una dificultad de 5 por lo cual el
jugador recibe 5 fichas de favor estar
acá tiene una dificultad de 4 por lo
cual el jugador recibe 4 fichas de favor
una vez recibidas las fichas un jugador
coloca su vitral dentro de su tablero
personal y estaremos listos para
comenzar el juego y este juego es muy
sencillo al principio de cada ronda
judicial va a tener esta bolsa entonces
él deberá sacar de la bolsa tantos datos
como el doble de la cantidad de
jugadores más uno en este caso 7
entonces aquí tenemos 1 2 3 4 5 6 y 7 y
luego los lanzara
una vez que los ha lanzado comenzando
por el jugador inicial dicho jugador
deberá escoger uno de estos dados y
colocarlo en su vital y las reglas de
colocación son las siguientes como
pueden ver aquí cada vital consta con
tres tipos de casillas
tenemos casillas coloreadas que
evidentemente requerirán un dado del
color determinado es decir aquí solo
puede ir un dado amarillo además tenemos
estas casillas con números o sombras más
claras o más oscuras temáticamente
hablando que requiere un dado de un
valor específico y finalmente tenemos
las casillas en blanco que permiten
cualquier tipo de dado sin embargo hay
una restricción adicional dos dados del
mismo color jamás podrán tocarse y dos
dados del mismo valor jamás podrá
tocarse ortogonal mente entonces dado
que estos fueron los datos que salieron
supongamos
vamos a revelar esto como este jugador
le interesa mucho los dados lila porque
no lo mencioné pero cada dado lila este
jugador le dará un punto por cada punto
que tengan dado entonces por ejemplo si
se llevase este 6 de acá recibiría 6
puntos de victoria al final de la
partida siguiendo las reglas de
colocación el primer dado debe ser
colocado en algunas de las orillas del
tablero
sería muy intentado colocarlo aquí o
aquí pero si lo coloca acá entonces ya
no podrá colocar un dado y puesto que
tendría 26 puntos y si lo coloca acá
entonces ya no podrá colocar un dado
lila y puesto que serían dos dados lilas
adyacentes lo importante es que no
pueden estar presentes ortogonal mente
en diagonal si está permitido entonces
supongamos que el jugador decide colocar
este dado digamos en esta casilla de acá
como ya mencioné el primer dado debe ser
colocado en una de las orillas del
tablero
entonces le corresponderá el turno al
siguiente jugador en escoger un dado y
digamos que decide escoger este saca un
4 de color celeste que quedara decente a
un 5 a un 6 y que este jugador de acá
decide escoger por ejemplo digamos que
este 3 de color amarillo luego una vez
que todos los jugadores han escogido un
dado se escogerá el segundo dado pero
esta vez en sentido contrario es decir
comenzará este jugador de acá que
digamos que decide tomar este 6 de color
verde este jugador de acá que también
toma un 6 de color verde y este jugador
de acá que digamos que toma este 2 de
color celeste
los dados que se coloquen después del
primero debe de estar adyacentes ya sea
ortogonal o diagonalmente a un dado
previamente colocado por ello estos
jugadores no podían haber colocado un
dado muy lejos del dado original y esa
es la mecánica básica de cada ronda
finalmente el dado que sobre se coloca
en la casilla de la ronda para indicar
que esa ronda ya fue completada en caso
de que sobre más dados porque supongamos
que un jugador decidió pasar porque tú
puedes elegir no tomar un dado entonces
todos los dados que sobren serán
colocados en la misma casilla
evidentemente no se deben tapar más
casillas de ronda
dado que el juego cuenta con 10 rondas
esa es la mecánica básica del juego
lanzar dados tomar en sentido horario y
tomar en sentido contrario
adicionalmente en su turno un pool
podría gastar fichas de favor para
utilizar una carta de favor
el orden en que se utiliza esto es
primero tomar un dado luego utilizar la
carta y luego colocar el dado como vemos
aquí las cartas de favor otorgan
distintos poderes a los jugadores por
ejemplo esta carta a cada permite al
jugador incrementar o disminuir el valor
de un dado en uno nunca cambiando de 6 a
1 de 1 a 6 esta carta acá permite mover
un dado de tu vitral a cualquier
posición del tablero ignorando las
restricciones de las sombras por ejemplo
en este ejemplo aquí el jugador está
moviendo un 3 azul a esta casilla que
requería un 1 como dice la carta el
resto de las restricciones debe
respetarse
es decir no podría haber movido un 3
amarillo a esa casilla de ahí y esta
vacada por ejemplo permite al jugador
robar un dado inmediatamente después de
haber robado el primero desde la ronda
en ese caso no jugará su segundo turno
de la ronda estos son tres ejemplos de
cartas pero como pueden ver existen
variadas cartas en el juego que tocarán
distintas habilidad
y variarán en cada partida
para poder utilizar estas cartas los
jugadores como ya mencioné deben
utilizar fichas de favor la primera
persona que utilice una carta deberá
pagar una ficha de favor todos los
jugadores que posteriormente utilicen la
carta deberán pagar dos fichas del favor
cada vez así al principio la partida
puede ser barato utilizar uno de estos
poderes pero en realidad los poderes son
más importantes más avanzada la partida
cuando nuestros vitrales se vayan
llenando y no sea más difícil colocar un
dado entonces en eso básicamente
consiste el juego más tardados colocar
dados activar poderes de ser necesario y
colocar los dados en nuestro tablero
a medida que esto se vaya llenando será
más difícil cada vez cumplir con las
restricciones del tablero y cumplir con
la restricción de adyacencia de colores
y números así es posible que algunas de
estas casillas queden en blanco entonces
al final de la partida
cada joven percibir un punto por cada
punto de dado que tengan el color
indicaba por indicado por su objetivo
inicial además de recibir los puntos
indicados por los objetivos comunes que
hayan salido durante la partida por
ejemplo en este caso cada parte cinco y
seis colocados en cualquier parte del
tablero otorgarán dos puntos de victoria
cada uno estará acá para puntos de
victoria por la cantidad de dados
adyacentes diagonalmente que se toquen
en este caso por ejemplo tendríamos azul
uno dos tres cuatro adyacentes tres al
decente diagonalmente de color amarillo
y serían siete puntos de victoria
evidentemente pueden haber más colores
estos son ejemplos y estar acá otorgará
cuatro puntos de victoria por cada
columna en que las
sean de distinto color es decir por cada
columna en que hayan dados de distintos
valores entonces podría ser uno dos tres
cuatro o cinco columnas finalmente cada
espacio que no hayamos logrado llenar
nos quitará un punto de victoria y cada
ficha de favor que nos quede al final de
la partida nos otorgará un punto de
victoria entonces el jugador que en la
suma de objetivos personales objetivos
generales favor los restantes y la resta
de espacios vacíos tenga más puntos de
victoria va a ser el ganador
en caso de empate va a ganar el jugador
que haya obtenido más puntos por su
objetivo personal

bow is Jane corner presents gencon video
bonanza 2016 brought to you by gutshot
games and their gin con release
headhunters a collectible card game in a
collectible toy and shooting in games
makers of looting Atlantis and
conspiracy look for pinball showdown on
Kickstarter soon also brought to you by
the generous support of these companies
and our fantastic Kickstarter backers oh
hi there YouTube I'm backing a nick more
of our gencon bonanza explosion blog
coverage we're here live at gencon 2016
right now we are at the floodgate games
as good booth that's what these are
called with Ben who is he is El
Presidente correct you were the top dog
and we're gonna be learning about the
upcoming Kickstarter sagrada yeah this
is sagrada by Darrell Andrews and Adrian
Adam Adam SQ se dice drafting game where
you're crafting a stained glass window
to to build that out in order to gain
the most victory points to be the best
artisan so how does it play was walk us
through everything here sure so each
player has their own board with the
restrictions on it of what's required
for each color and shade represented by
the numbers on the dice players will be
drafting these dice and in rounds in
order to fill out their board so
starting with whoever the star player is
they'll grab five dice in a two-player
game roll them and then draft one of the
dice so now there's a couple
restrictions you need to follow for
instance here we need to place a five
any colors just fine so that would be
good placement for us here or if we're
looking at the color restrictions we
could place a purple dye here but
there's two rules you can never break
you can never put two dice of the same
color next to each other and never put
two dice to the same number next to each
other so as you're drafting you need to
be aware of that those restrictions so
you're planning for the for the future
actions that are coming so let's say
this player is going to draft one of the
dice here then in in player order we're
going to go to this next player and
they're going to draft a dye onto their
player board and it's a snake draft so
this player is actually going to draft
to now you have to build out from the
dice you've already drafted
and then we'll come back to this other
player and then they'll graph one more
you might be wondering why in the world
are we doing this besides the fact that
it's fun to place dice we've got a whole
bunch of variables in game scoring
conditions so for having each row
without repeated colors you're going to
gain six points free throw with out
repeated shades the number on the die
you're going to get gained five points
and then again four columns without
repeated colors five points there these
are variable so that changes up the game
quite a bit every game is going to have
a different set of scoring conditions so
this remaining guy will go on a round
track to keep track of the what round
Ratt in the game there will be ten
rounds in every game and we'll continue
passing the dice bag drafting dice as we
go these these player boards end up
getting pretty restricted by the by the
time we've drafted a whole bunch of dice
as you can see not breaking those rules
becomes really hard so what we do is
each player starts with some favor
tokens we're going to use these to pay
for the tools that are available to help
us break those rules this one for
instance let us lets us shift one of our
dice around in our board ignoring the
shade restriction so we can maybe shift
this five over to cover up the two if we
need to rearrange things to get a little
more flexibility that'll cost us one of
our favor tokens in order to do that
placing it on the card now the first
time you use one it only costs one each
subsequent time it's going to cost to in
order to use them so you're encouraged
to use them early as you go we have a
whole bunch of these tool cards too so
that also changes up at tons of
variability between these two the game
state doesn't change much in turn in
terms of what you're expecting here so
it's easy to plan around but creates a
fresh new experience every time each
player also has a private objective so
every player is going for the most the
most pips of a particular color that
they can this gives you a little bit of
mystery as to how you're going to plan
on winning because you don't share this
with your opponents and it always makes
players feel like they're still in the
game which is really fun game plays in
about 30 minutes per player it's two to
four players and we do have one player
variance as well and when did you say
this is coming to geeks are we're doing
Kickstarter on sep tember 12 do you have
a tentative idea of how much just
getting the base game will cost
nothing yet but if you check out the
project will have it all on there and
kick starters always appreciated to get
people's support and if they're more
interested in sagrada or any of the
other floodgate games where should we
send them floodgate gamescom or you can
check us out on twitter thank you very
much been that is the upcoming
Kickstarter pursue granite looks very
cool they're a beautiful lots of
variability looks really awesome was not
on my radar and now it is but you're

hi welcome to watch it played my name is
Rodney Smith and in this video we're
going to learn the one two four player
game sagrada designed by darryl andrews
and adrian adam escu and published by
floodgate games the construction of the
sagrada familia church began in 1882 and
it still continues to this day
you and the other players will be taking
on the roles of artists competing to
make the most beautiful stained-glass
window within this magnificent structure
so join me at the table and let's learn
how to play to set up shuffle these
private objective cards with a grade i
on the back and then deal one to each
player in this video we're gonna set up
a two-player game you may always
secretly look at your own private
objective but you must keep it hidden
from the other players each player is
now randomly dealt two of these
double-sided window pattern cards from
this shuffle deck they'll each pick one
pattern and one side and return the
other to the box the dots showing in
this corner will indicate how difficult
the pattern will be to work with but the
more difficult the more of these favored
tokens you'll receive which can aid you
during the game as we'll see later at
this time now take a number of these
tokens equal to those showing here now
take any one of these window frame
player boards and slide your chosen
window pattern face up into the bottom
of it like this then collect a matching
score marker each player should put
their score marker next to this round
track that you should also keep nearby
these are the tool cards which you'll
shuffle dealing three face-up into the
center of the playing area cards with
this back our public objectives that
you'll also shuffle and deal three face
up from all remaining tools objectives
and window cards can now be returned to
the box there are 90 dice included in
the game and they should be mixed into
this bag which you'll then hand to the
start player that person can be chosen
randomly or you could choose the person
who most recently visited a cathedral
either way that's the setup in sagrada
players will be collecting colored dice
that represent pieces of glass that
they'll fit within their window as they
try to create pattern
that will score them points at the end
of the game the game itself is played
over ten rounds at the beginning of each
round the first player will draw
randomly from this bag a number of dice
equal to twice the number of players
plus one so in our two-player game here
we draw five dice these are then rolled
into a central area and form the draft
pool now starting with the first player
and going clockwise around the table
every person gets one turn and once
everyone has had a turn that last player
now takes a second one along with
everybody else but this time going in
reverse order and on your turn there are
two different actions you can take once
each and in any order and neither are
mandatory so let's go back to the table
and I'll show you how they work one
option is to select one die and to do
this you pick one from the draught pool
here and place it into any empty space
of your personal window frame following
some important guidelines for example
the first die you pick must be placed
into one of the spaces that go around
the outside edge of your window then
every future die you collect must be put
into a space adjacent to a previously
placed died including diagonally so for
example on a future turn I couldn't go
here but I could go here here or here
now that said the spaces themselves may
have some restrictions based on the
colors or symbols that you see within
them for example if you see a red space
like this only a red die may be placed
into it likewise if you see a value also
known as a shade only a die with that
value showing on top may be placed there
and a white space like this can contain
any value or color however no matter
what color or value a space contains a
die may never be placed so that it
shares a full side with a die of the
same color or same value for example
while this space could normally hold any
type of die I couldn't place either a
green more value for die here because it
would share a full side with this one
which is also green and also for
matching colors or values can be placed
diagonally adjacent however so this
purple one
can be diagonally adjacent to this
purple one if while playing you ever
discover that a person's window breaks
any of the placement rules they must
immediately remove dice of their choice
from their window returning them to the
box until all the rules are correctly
obeyed for example in this situation we
can see we have dice of the same color
and value adjacent to each other so the
player might remove this one the other
action that you can also take on your
turn if you want to is to use one of
these tool cuts and you'll do this by
placing one of your favorite tokens onto
an empty card and resolving its ability
for example this one says that after
drafting a die you can flip it to the
opposite side before placing it within
your stained-glass window now if a tool
already has favor tokens on it you may
still use it on your turn but you'll
have to spend to favor tokens to do so
in other words when a tool is first used
it'll cost one favor and after that two
favors each time so those are the two
actions selecting one die and or using
one tool and you can do that in either
order and you can choose to perform only
one or neither of those actions if you'd
like and after everyone has performed
one turn in clockwise order and then one
more turn in counterclockwise order it's
the end of the round you now put all
remaining dice from the draft pool onto
the leftmost empty space of this round
track and it is possible that you might
have more than one die left over if
someone didn't select a die during their
turn and in that case the leftover dice
are stacked one on top of each other the
dice bag is now passed clockwise and
that person will be the first player for
the next round that said if you've just
completed the 10th round the game ends
and it's time to score first you clear
this round track and then flip it over
having players use their score markers
here to keep track of their points if
this would ever cause them to go past 50
points they flip their token over to the
50 side and continue counting from the
beginning first you gain one victory
point for each favor token that you
didn't use for each public objective
where you've completed its instructions
as printed here at the bottom you'll
gain its indicated points here and you
can even score the same
card more than once if you satisfy its
requirements multiple times in different
ways within your window for example
you'll score six points for each row
that you have that doesn't have
repeating colors so looking at our
stained glass here this would include
the very top row as well as the bottom
row for a total of twelve points now
reveal your private objective and score
points for it as well this says that I
sum together the values of all of the
green dice within my stained glass
window and add that to my total score so
in this case fifteen more points
finally you remove one victory point for
each open space within your window for
example if I hadn't had dice in these
spaces and I would now subtract two
points from my total now the person with
the most points wins and in the case of
a tie the tied player with the most
points from their private objectives
wins and if still tied check for who has
the most favored tokens left if still
tied the player seated furthest from the
first player in clockwise order during
that final round is the winner the game
also includes rules for solo play but
I'll leave those for you to discover on
your own otherwise that's everything you
need to know to place the grata now if
you have any questions at all about
anything that you saw here don't
hesitate to put them in the comments
below and I'll gladly answer them as
soon as I get a chance but until the
next episode thanks for watching

TRANSCRIPCIÓN:
hey everybody this is me the undead
viking and this is sagrada sagrada is a
bag dice building game where you are
going to be trying to create
a stained glass window uh sagrada is i
guess the ground of basilica it's a very
very famous church which has some
awesome windows in it apparently
i didn't know about that until i
actually uh googled it and found out and
check it out that's really cool
uh but the game is a very very
light-hearted but very tricky puzzle
game in which you're going to be taking
dice that have been rolled and then
you're going to be drafting those dice
onto your stained glass window and
trying to create the best when you can
while satisfying your own personal
private goals and also some public goals
that are out there you also have access
to some tools that allow you to
manipulate the dice a little bit
and it's a heck of a lot of fun so why
don't i show you how to play and then
we'll come back here and i'll tell you
what i think
all right cool all right here we go this
is sagrada now this is as i said
a dice manipulation building bag
game i don't know it's got a lot of
different things going on but it is
relatively simple
relatively quick but it is super tricky
to play now let me show you how it is
done okay so
these are the cards we're going to start
with and also there are these player
boards i'll talk about these in just a
quick second
but the first thing you have to do is
that each game is going to be different
because each person
is going to get one of these random
private goal cards and they're basically
this is the different shades
red shades red yellow green blue and
purple and you get one of these random
this is
yours and yours alone however everybody
obviously knows that these are the
colors
uh basically you're gonna get extra
points for each time you use this
specific color so you're gonna be trying
to figure out ways
that you get that so let's just say uh
i'll you know i'll do it right away
see what i get uh yellow all right so
the yellow view
your secret one so you turn that over
you don't show it to anybody
everybody else gets one of these and
then there are these
public ones that you go after and each
one of these is a way to score points
you can see
six points so if you have um a row on
your
on your window that is one of each color
uh that's worth six points and everybody
can know that and then a column is worth
five
um the shade basically means the shades
are like the different numbers so as
long as the
the numbers are all different uh then
you know so on so forth so you earn
those points
that way and so there's you know and so
you go ahead and shuffle these up
and then you're gonna draw uh three of
these at random
and these will be three uh different uh
communal uh chances so let's see what we
get here um so this is
um deep shades so sets of five and six
will be worth two points
and let's see here and we're going to
get a row shade
variety a row with no repeated shades or
numbers basically
and then the last one is going to be uh
the columns alright
so those are our three and then
there are these tool cards uh the tools
cards allow you to basically manipulate
the dice in
in a certain way so let's just i'm going
to grab three and we'll just see them
see which ones we get here let's see one
two and three all right
and so of these let's see here we get um
copper foil burnisher move any one piece
in your window
uh ignoring shade restriction after
drafting place the piece
with out connecting to another piece
because normally you have to put the
dice next to each other
and then grinding stone after drafting
flip the piece to its opposite side
so we're going to go ahead and place
those three tools out like so
all right so now the one difference
between what i have and what's going to
come out
uh with when the game is uh comes out is
that each
person um is going to get a board that's
going to have several different
options as far as their windows go and
basically they're going to be easy ones
because you
you this is kind of spread out and
basically the white means you can put
whatever you want down
but everything else is like specifically
you have to put a purple here you have
to have a number four here and so forth
and the trick of the game is is that you
can't put either
numbers orthogonally next to each other
or colors orthogonally next to each
other so that can get a little tricky
so you'll like and so this is like an
easier one you can tell it's easier
because this little these little dots
down here
and so then like they blossom up to more
difficult ones
and so forth and so what's going to
happen and also in the back
you can see there's like that's you know
all
all different numbers there and then
like you know so and so forth so what
you'll do is you'll get a a board
that'll have several different options
for you
and then you can choose which one you
want to take so if you want to go easy
street
you can just go with this one and put
that down and that's what you're going
to be trying to
fill out and then you're gonna get
this little three there you're gonna get
three of these tokens that you're gonna
be able to use
to buy the right to use those tools now
the first time anybody uses a tool it
just takes one token to use it
the second time somebody else wants to
use it they have to spend two so
for the most part those aren't going to
get used a lot but if you have the extra
tokens
and you save them they're going to be
worth extra points at the end of the
round after the game so
even if you don't use them and like if
you go the route
of you know this big like the the
tougher ones that are that are tougher
to figure out
um you know with all the different uh
colors and so on so forth and you get
that the larger number of the the tokens
um if you hold on to them you know
they're gonna be worth extra points so
the way the game works is that whoever
is the first player you just determine
that randomly
um they're going to take so if we have
three players
um each person is going to get two dice
per round and so you draw
you you take dice out equal to the
number of players
uh times two plus one if that makes
sense
so with three players you're gonna have
seven so it's three times two six plus
one is seven so
one two three four
five six seven all right so that's what
we got and so
we didn't get any red um it doesn't look
like but we did get a blue we got a
green
we got a yellow and so what happens the
first round
is that you're gonna roll these dice and
then the first player does that
and they're going to pick one of those
dice and they're going to add it
to their board with the idea of one
trying to satisfy they want yellow so we
probably want to grab that yellow
die that's out there and they get to
place it on their board now the first
thing you place it you have to place it
on an
edge you can't place it in the middle
after that as i said you have to place
on the dice next to each other as you go
on so if we take
this two like so and you put it right
there bam now that probably isn't the
best decision i could have made because
you'll notice
that means that i can't place a die
there actually i'm going to take that
back because that's a very poor decision
basically because there is a 2 on that
spot
meaning that i have to place a 2 there
so if i have this 2
that would go there and that kind of
stinks that like i could i mean i could
if i wanted to if i wanted to spend a
point i could say
after drafting flip the piece the
opposite side so we can go
two and then we're gonna flip it over
and make it a
five and that's a completely valid thing
and now
if i want to get a 2 i can go ahead and
pick that as well
so let's just say the next person goes
they take this and then
and then the third person takes this
blue one and then the next person
uh and then it's a serpentine draft so
like
uh if you're familiar with that so
basically uh the third person goes the
last person goes in this round they're
gonna go twice they're gonna take that
one
and they take this and then it goes like
that and it gets back to me and this two
is available
and so why don't i i can just slide that
two onto that spot and that is
completely valid
now diagonal moves are allowed those are
considered to be next to each other and
so then they go
now you take this other die and you
place that basically
there's gonna be a turn track when the
game uh gets released
but you place that dive there on it'll
be like the turn track and that would
show that round one is done and there is
a ten
round game and so then you hand the bag
of all the dice
the next person and they're gonna take
seven more of these
and then let's see here one two three
four
five six seven wow i still haven't
gotten a red one that's crazy so whoever
like got boned and got like the red
like private one you know they're kind
of cursing their luck right now
so we're gonna roll this and still
because i went first now you're gonna go
last so the next person goes i'm just
gonna say let's see
they took that yellow you're like yeah
you jerk you took the yellow next person
goes bam
and so now it's my turn so now i can
start trying to maybe fill out
situations so here i can go i can go
with the four there and i could hit
the one here now i've actually set
myself up pretty well
um uh you know with uh
for regards to this one because look i
have a one two and a five if i can
somehow get a six
and like a three in that spot i'd be
able to go ahead and fulfill this
now and also you know it's like you know
and i've got a five down there so if i
can get a six
on the bottom row i mean i'd be able to
satisfy this as well and so you can kind
of see how the game evolves at this
point
and as you start using up the spots on
your window
um and you start getting constricted you
start getting that space and i should
mention
also it's very important that every spot
that you don't manage to fill
in uh you know of your little puzzle
your little window puzzle
at the end of 10 rounds it's worth
negative one points so
after all is said and done i'm not going
to go through every single round uh
you're going to figure out how many
spaces you have left
though and then if you didn't fill out
those are worth -1 points
you count up how much you've satisfied
your private one you kind of how much
you've satisfied as far as
uh the the communal options that you're
shooting for
what however many of these tokens you
have left are still are worth one point
and whoever has the most points
obviously
uh will be the winner of this game um
it is a lot of fun i love dice it is a
very colorful game
every time i brought this to my local
game store i played it everybody stopped
and stared and looked i think it has a
lot to do with these
super awesome cool colorful dice and
plus the the dice action the rolling and
the interactivity um you know it
plays in about a half hour it's one of
those perfect family games that you can
teach in about
five minutes and everybody's gonna learn
how to play it and know how to play it
and have a lot of fun with it but
let me talk more about that uh in my
final thoughts i just want to say i for
one
have always hated the terminology of
gateway game
anything can be a gateway game it
doesn't have to be a simple game it
doesn't have to be
a straightforward game it doesn't have
to be like you know some
you know like pillars of the earth or it
doesn't have to be some ticket to ride
my gateway game was arkham horror for
crying out loud
but i will say this i think sagrada is a
wonderful gateway game
um as i said when i brought this to my
local game store and i was playing it i
had more than a few people stop and like
ask about it
look at it check it out ask to play the
game try it out
and um i even had people that like
basically were like there to drop
off other people that weren't really
gamers per se and they were really
excited to play it and i had a couple
people like they wanted to know where
they could buy it right then right then
immediately and like i basically had to
say
you have to wait a little bit and back
on kickstarter and they were a little
disappointed but
i think i'm sure they backed it by now
but i
the thing is is that it has everything
that it needs to be that type of game
that type of family game it has really
really straightforward rules
um it affords a lot of communal thinking
because of the fact that like when
people are trying to figure which die to
pick you know it just
it's your nature to try to say you know
maybe take that one and put it there or
what have you
and it is something that kind of can
bridge the gaps if you will everybody's
playing games with dice everybody's like
you know
done like a football draft with the
serpentine thing you know i mean so it
has a lot of
uh things going for it that are just
really really
comfortable and like you know that that
comfort level or whatever
isn't isn't too imposing um my family
loves it we played a lot of it uh my son
maybe a little bit too young but both my
wife and my daughter really took to it
and had a great
great fun with it so um if you're
looking for one of those games that like
kind of bridges that gap and also is
that perfect
wind-up game for the big game or like
after the game night is winding down
just a quick game you can play right
before everybody goes home i really
suggest you uh
check out sagrada i don't think you'll
be disappointed uh if you have any
questions about the game ask away i'll
be happy to answer those to the best of
my ability
uh thank you very much as always for
taking the time to watch this video and
until next time i'm the end of viking
and i'm telling you
to have yourself one heck of an awesome
day all right bye

hello my friends it's the Gameboy geek
here today we're going to be building
beautiful stained glass with the light
coming through glistening through it
just look like a beautiful sight we're
going to be putting each of those panes
and they're glass we're going to decide
which color goes where that's what we're
doing today we're looking at sagrada
this is from floodgate games this is for
one to four players and this is sort of
a puzzle ii styled dice drafting game
with some special abilities let me say
how it's played and i'll see you on the
other side
[Music]
in sagrada you first get to choose one
of these four beautiful glass windows
that you'll be creating you also get to
select one of these grids there's 24
total that you can select from and they
go from difficulty 3 all the way up to 6
you get compensated for the harder ones
but you select one of these you'll
actually place it right into your
stained glass so it looks something like
this once you've inserted and over the
course of the game certain spaces have
either color restrictions as to which
color dye has to go in there or what
they call shade restrictions or which
dye value has to go there each player
will also be given a private gold card
this should be facedown but you need to
look at it this says shades of purple
now for every purple dye I get here I'll
get to add up the sum of the Pips on
those Purple's as a scoring at the end
of the game and everyone's going to have
a different color basically all of these
are all the different colors of the dice
that you'll see in the game everyone
gets one of these also three public
goals will be placed down now it's
actually ten of these in the game but
only three will get used each game
they're randomly selected and this is
how you score throughout the game in
addition to your one private goal that I
just went over here you'll have things
like this which is light shades set one
sets of one and two values of one and
two of any color will get you two points
or every set of those the middle one
says hey a row with no repeated color so
every roll that you have it does not
repeat a color will get you six points
and on the right color diagonal so you
cut the diagonally adjacent same colored
dice they don't have to be the blue or
yellow shown here as long as it is the
same same amount of dice that are the
same color its diagonal you'll get a
point so in this case would be one two
three four five six seven that would be
where seven points in the game if your
board looked like that now how a round
works is there's a bag of dice and the
star player is going to take the amount
of dice that's basically 2 times the
amount of players plus one so if we're
playing with two players I'm going to
pull five dice they're going to roll
those dice and let's say it comes up
like this the first player will be able
to pull the first dye and draft it and
then the second player is going to be
able to pull two in a row and then the
let first player is going to be able to
put a last die they'll be one left over
so always it goes into like a serpentine
Draft where if you get the first choice
you'll also get the last choice so let's
say I pull this purple three now there's
some placement
at the beginning you have to place it on
the edge somewhere but let's say this is
purple I have to put a purple here I
could put it pretty much in any of these
other spot out here I can even put it in
this pot because this needs a three and
this is a three I could not put it here
because this needs a red this is a
purple I could not put it here because
it's a five and this is a three but this
is purple any number I'll place it here
then the other player would select two
dice so let's say the other player
selected two dice and I have two left to
choose from the last player will always
have two to choose from they will select
a dye and place it so this is a four now
whenever you place a dye after the first
diet always has to be adjacent either
up-down left-right or diagonal to at
least one other dye in your window so my
only placement could be here here here
here or here right now this needs to be
a four and so let's say I'll just go
like this because that is a four it's a
good spot
the last dye here would get placed on
this board this essentially is a round
counter so we don't we know what round
one's over the game is only ten rounds
and then the start player would go
clockwise that player would now take the
dye tile bag roll and continue as I just
showed now let's say the player rolled
the dice they took their won and it's my
choice I love this purple six because if
you remember my private goal was to get
every tip on the Purple's was going to
be points for me however you can never
there's placement rules now remember you
have to place a dye a Jason to at least
one die now I would like the places here
because there's a six that I can't why
because you can never place the same
colored dye orthogonal II adjacent to
any dye that's already there so I could
not place this here however I could
place it something like this now if I
want to take this for I could not place
it here because in addition to not being
on place the same color adjacent you can
never place the same number orthogonal
ages to any other die of the same color
so I could not place that so I would
like to take this and since I can't
place it here I would place it maybe
something like that so those are the two
main placement rules in the game now in
addition to those placement rules there
are ways to break those rules each game
there are three tools you'll see those
cards here now there's a random there's
actually 12 of them in a game but you
only use three of them
to do this you can activate these tools
and break the rules of the game for
example after your first turn
immediately drafted I skip your next
turn so if you're you know if you're in
the middle of the round you can take one
die and take another one right away
that's pretty cool
the middle one lens cutter after
drafting a die you can swap the graph to
die with one from the round track as we
showed you earlier pretty cool and the
glazing hammer on the right reroll all
dice in the draft pool this may only be
used on your second turn before drafting
so it's like you know after you've taken
one die now how do you use these well if
I told you in the beginning the cards
that you put into your stained glass are
between 3 & 6 of difficulty for each one
of these spots so this was the easiest
one you would get one of these tokens
now if you're the first person to
activate one of these you place one
there and you get to activate it if
someone else has already gone there
regardless of how many you have to spend
to to go there so you get more rule
breaking abilities with the harder cards
because you'll get more gems now there
are sometimes will you'll make mistakes
you might place the same number or color
next to something that you're not
supposed to and as soon as you see it
you need to immediately remove dice up
to the point where it's no longer
breaking the rules and that will cause
you to have different things open and
squares not filled at the end of the
game like this needs a three but there's
a three here well I'm out of luck so
sometimes you'll have some empty squares
but at the end of the game you'll look
at all of the public goals and you'll
start to score so the first one here is
the colored diagonals so I could have
one two three four five six these are
all touching diagonal it's six points
this one one two three so now we're at
nine two more at 11 two more at 13 two
more at 15 15 points on just this card
that looks pretty good this makes one of
six points for every row that I have
that have different colors in them and
it's just this row with that six points
and now if I went from 15 to 21 then we
look at each set of 1 & 2 so here I have
three ones and three twos so I have
three full sets so 3 times 2 is 6 add
that to my 21 I have 27 then you would
flip over your private goal and we'd add
up all of the pips add up all the purple
and then I have a total score of 50 at
this point you'd then subtract a point
for each empty spot to a 49
and you'd get a point for each of those
favorite tokens that you didn't use
let's say I had one left over my points
would be 50 and whoever has the most is
the winner now there is a solo version
of the game you use one private go to
public goals and anywhere between one in
five tools the more tools the easier it
is for you each turn you draft four dice
and roll them as normal then you take
two turns either placing die it dice
into your window as normal or spending a
die and or sending a die on one of these
tools but there's no favorite tokens in
this version you'll use whatever is on
the top left of the cart so I can
activate this with any red die with a
blue die or five so I could put this
here activate this do what this tool
says and then the die and the card are
out of the game for the rest it's a
one-time use for my second term maybe I
put this into my window all the
remaining dice go on here at the end of
the game you're going to add up all
hundred pips on these dice and you have
to beat that score to win all right well
there is Sagrada first of all Wow unique
theme how often have you heard about a
game about making stained-glass windows
I like unique themes this one works well
it's actually quite somatic I love the
components man that those big windows
that you get in the way you slide the
little card in they're just a really
cool touch I really like the overall
look and feel of this game now this game
is a puzzle game and I typically love
puzzle a style games anything that
reminds me of putting together a puzzle
or some logic and deducing or anything
like that I typically tend to love those
style games this game really hit all
cylinders for my brain from a puzzle II
aspect there's just a different puzzle
to solve every time you play it because
there's different boards so you have a
different card just twenty-four
different ones and depending on the
difficulty you know you take a different
thing you know you get easier ways to
break the rules of the game so you have
the different replayability of the
different boards twenty-four different
one then you have the different specials
private abilities then you have all the
different public goals that can be
randomly assigned so this game has a ton
of replayability built in and I love the
puzzle to solve here the dice drafting
is awesome it's fun to to drop the dice
you want you get excited there's some
tension there there's also some room for
some hate drafting where hey it's like
down to
you and there's just one other player
after you you've got you know a few guys
to choose from and you're looking for
Matt you're going okay I could really
use this one or this one
that person really needs this one I'm
going to take it and you know really
screw them over and it can be mean but
it was a fun aspect of a game of dice
tracting even though it's serpentine
works really well I like the way that
that worked there but overall the puzzle
the puzzle was awesome the drafting was
awesome I really like that aspect and
even know what a 17 draft you know it's
a even if you were first I like that I
kind of like a fantasy football draft
growing everywhere hey you get first
pick and you better make it you know pay
because you're going to get the last
choice afterwards I really think that
works well and how it goes around the
table works well as well I love that
aspect of the private and public goals
in any game I always love it when
there's private goals that nobody knows
about and then as public goals of course
in this game the private goals are
always just the colors of the dice and
so it's pretty obvious to kind of look
at what people are going for and you can
usually tell which a private goal
they're going for and try to again draft
so that they don't get those bigger
numbers for those colors but I love how
you have the private goal the public
goals at the same time trying to work
those together I also love those tools
so the tools to break the rules of the
game it's such a clever thing that
there's there's I think there's ten of
them or so and then you get only three
of them each game and they change each
game so again more replayability and you
get to use those those tools to really
break the rules and I love how it's
balanced with how difficult your board
was so if you have the easy board and
you only have three of those those
tokens you're probably going to be able
to get one maybe two of those things
done if you're if you know you'll get
two of them done if you got there quick
and so I like that aspect someone who
took a really hard board needs to be
able break the rules more so they're
getting six of those so they can even go
to one of e to the three of them and
even be last to each of those three and
still be able to get them done I think
that's a really cool mechanism in this
game I really liked it I really liked
the solo version of this game as well
I'm not typically too big of a solo
player but one Saturday morning you know
after I got the game just kind of
playing with it when I think it works it
is hard though I've played this
probably seven times and I'm yeah I've
yet to beat it I mean it's really hard
because you're trying to add up the
number of dice versus you know the
scoring on the dice versus that's a good
solo game although it's very hard any
cause on this well analysis paralysis
can become an issue here especially
during a dice drafting phase because it
early in the face when there's a lot of
dice out there if you're playing with a
lot of players for players let's just
say there's a lot of dice to be getting
first or second player then sometimes if
they have analysis processes can drag
the game a little bit wasn't enough to
really you know make me not like the
game or like it lesson but just be
knowing that if you player players that
typically have an ounce prowess you want
to be wary of that
I limit to from a production standpoint
I love the dice I love how they're sort
of translucent I loved how they fit
perfectly the only problem is they're
small and they're rounded edges and so a
lot of times you'll go to pick up a die
and it will just like flip on you and
this happened quite often so after a
while you just get used to it you look
at the number and you're looking at the
number and you you're remembering it as
you pull it so if it does flip then when
you're putting in the board sometimes it
flips I wish they maybe would have done
square dice with square edges so it
wouldn't flip it is easily but again a
small on a minor nitpick of the two
cause I found in this game this game's
amazing - love it love it love it simple
rules great depth great replayability
changes every game love it so much and
I'm keeping in my gaming library so

IDIOMA DETECTADO: en
TRANSCRIPCIÓN:
hello everyone and welcome to the
one-stop co-op shop today I'm going to
be doing a solo player of Sagrada if
you'd like to see how to set up the game
check out the video before this in the
playlist otherwise let's get going let's
grab our four dice to start our first
round give them a roll with this roll
not a great roll
I was hoping that this blue which would
give us points would be higher but only
a two so I think I'm going to grab this
six and I have to start anywhere on the
outside of this board and I'm going to
start right here now everything that I
didn't play has to be in this area has
to be adjacent to this guy either
orthogonal or diagonally so I'm going to
grab this five and place that man right
here but I have to move that five
eventually because I'm going to need a
five here but this way I only put three
points up onto the track but if you
think about it I scored zero with this
so already the opponent is up free
nothing here's the tracker will put one
and two let's go to round two grab and
floor dice from the bag sometimes it's
hard the types are kind of small okay
here we go I'm not too unhappy with this
rule and here's why I'm going to use
this tool the grinding stone I'm going
to draft this blue dye which is remember
that the Dinitz going to give me points
and I'm going to give up this green to
here to use the grinding stones now I
can't use it but I can now flip a guy to
its opposite side so I'm going to flip
this one to a six that gives a six point
yes I'm going to put that six right here
again it's a diagonal so that works and
the sixes are okay because they're not
worth cognitive then I'm just going to
draft this yellow three and place it
right here now if I get this four I'm
going to get four points because I have
different numbers in all four of these
places so that's what I'm looking for
and the round two will place this three
here so now our opponent has three four
five
six points and we have six because we
have that blue dye pull that out grab
and for more looking for blues come on
blues no no blows in this tile what we
do have is a ton of force so I'm going
to grab this green 4 and place this here
that's going to give a four point right
here and we're still doing okay with our
colors this way next I'm going to use
this lay skin I'm going to give up this
for purple dye to move exactly two dice
about obeying all placement restrictions
I'm going to move this five one over I'm
going to place this three over here in
the yellow spot I can direct one more
dye and I'm going to draft this six and
I'm going to put this six right here so
that way I have lost some points here
but this way I'm not putting so many
points up for the opponent and I'm
hoping I should still be able to get
this done around three and our opponent
gets four more points looking for blues
you guys think blues thoughts at me
please
let's see nope no blues bummer I'm going
to place this five right here I'm going
to grab this five and place it here so
remember the numbers only matter to be
different the different shades this way
and the colors matter this fits why the
fact I have two five here should still
be okay if I can get two different
colors here so now we'll put five more
points up to the board for the opponent
three plus two and just keep adding to
them please you guys can do the rules
from blue here let's see one two three
four oh yeah I rolled a blue and it's a
blue one Wow
so they come in a grab this one and
place it here and then I'm going to grab
this Reed and place it up here we're
going to be walking two points to the to
our opponents two more points and I'm
going to say I think right now we have
six points in total that's it guaranteed
yeah here's a little more than six let's
go around six blue blue blue blue blue
no blue Wow lots of lo dice too so I
think we're going to grab this to place
that here and we'll grab this purple one
and place it right there but now we're
adding up five more points to our
opponent I don't even want to know what
he's at for numbers yes let's just keep
going
blues please one two three and guess
what no blues some higher numbers that's
maybe not a bad thing
we'll grab this yellow three that will
get us some points looking at this we're
just going to have to lose some points
here I think what I'm just going to have
to grab this five which is such a bummer
and plop it here but now we have two
five tiers so we're not going to get the
four points of the different numbers
here but maybe I can use one of our
items are our tools next time to help us
let's put these six points on the
opponent for six more points let's go to
round eight let's roll them up and we
get another blue that's a tattoo ah
first thing we're going to do we're
going to draft this too and it's blue
but we're going to use this yellow one
to increase this by one to a three
we can then place that right here then
we'll grab this for we'll place that
right here oh my goodness
and the roni we'll put a two here and if
you guys hear something I apologize or
something going on outside but I'm going
to keep going
only two more rounds at this point I'm
looking for a five or blue it's really
that's what I'm looking for
how about a blue five first thing I'm
going to do with a no-brainer grab this
green six put this here
all different shades that is awesome
unfortunately though that means we lose
these points I'm going to use this five
and draft this for I can't believe I'm
now using this five I don't look a place
to put it but I'm going to do this so I
can grab a dye from the ground track and
swap it with this for this actually
might not be a good idea because we're
giving them two more points but I am in
turn and getting a because almost ten
points four and six we have ten points
so I think it's worth it
so swapping it with this to we're then
going to place this to here and you can
see it I've got the four points here
plus the six points here nice but I have
to give up this five and it's blue I
just didn't have another good place to
put it moving on to the final round
let's roll our last four nice I've used
all four of my tools so it's just what
can I drag I for sure it can draft this
to here and that's going to get me six
more points yes unfortunately the four
four and one all will not work here
because there's a four and there's a
blue so I have to give up all three of
these to the opponent yes that is nine
points right there and now I have a
minus 3 because I didn't so my track all
right let's count them up our opponent
here has 42 points just by adding up the
dice let's go look at ours first let's
look at row color variety so these are
all different colors right so that's six
points these are all different points
that's 12 this has not even done and one
that's 18 points oh my gosh I didn't
even really got six 12 18 points next
let's look at column shade variety
failed failed that's four points failed
one two three and okay that eight points
so we're at 26 points next we'll look at
our personal color which is blue six
seven eight nine ten eleven so that's
going to give us thirty seven points
then we subtract three we're at 34
I believe our opponent with that forty
two so we lost ah
but it was close through the close game
and then you have it that's a grata on
the second two easiest mode with a nice
and easy a nice and easy stained-glass
window as you can see it's not easy
although you might have been right Khan
why didn't you do this
so I might have made some silly mistakes
but I tried to think about it a fun game
it's quick to play quick to set up I
highly recommend it especially if you
can travel at all this could totally fit
in a small bag you don't even need to
bring this just bring these little
sheets and you'd have so much fun and
you can play this over and over again
there's tons of different ones of these
there's the different the six different
colors or however many different colors
one two three four five different colors
the five different colors you can have
as personal objectives and it's really
fun competitively too it's it's a it's
not an in-your-face competitive but it's
you know hey you're drafting dice oh
well she took my blue that I wanted you
know whatever it's fun I am really
recommended thank you guys so much for
watching and have a good rest you today

this is the Sagrada família the
construction started in 1882 and it's
still going strong today it's a monument
and patients
inside that you'll find the famous
stained glass windows and the best part
is that someone made a game about this
[Music]
[Music]
Sagrada is a dice drafting window
building window and this is the Spanish
word for sacred so I guess in here
God is a gambler and just look at those
beautiful dyes they are cubic they are
kind of sexy in a weird way they should
make a cathedral out of them
and this is how you play it
the first thing you'll do is randomly
pick a grid for your window you'll then
roll the dice and draft them with the
other players you can then start to
build your window by carefully placing
each day but there are restrictions
[Music]
thankfully there are tools you can work
with along with private and public
objectives this game feels like taking a
hot shower in the winter while trying to
fix a broken clock except your friends
are all there with you messing with you
clock sagrada has a very satisfying
sense of progression but the game does
feel repetitive after multiple plays the
private objectives could be more
interesting and the solo mode is
impossible but look at those dice they
look like vitamins fresh like a
watermelon so it takes three minutes to
learn 30 minutes to play and I think I
will keep it for a long time sagrada is
a game with a certain perfume it has
character and it's artistic
just like stained glass

TRANSCRIPCIÓN:
hey everybody today R runs through
sigada which is a game of dice Drafting
and window crafting where players are
going to be designing some of the
immensely stunning stained glass windows
that Grace the sagata familia in
Barcelona if you ever find yourself in
Barcelona you must check out the sagata
Familia it is out of this world amazing
and one of the things it's most famous
for is it's beautiful beautiful stained
glass so that's what we're here to make
some of today all righty so we already
got the game set up here it was G to be
a two-player game this is my stained
glass piece I'm trying to build this is
Jen's and actually the real game I
should say everything you're seeing here
is prototypes the real game according to
these prototype rules i h mentioned show
that there's going to be this very very
cool dice tray holder that looks like a
big gigantic piece of stained glass and
it keeps your dice from you know
accidentally jostling around not now my
prototype of course I don't have one of
those I've just got the card and in fact
the game comes with a bunch of different
cards to uh ensure that every time you
play you're going to be having unique
problems and strategies and puzzles to
overcome so anyway this is mine this is
Jen's mine's strictly speaking a little
bit easier because I've got more of
these Open Spaces where I'm not
restricted what I want to play I've got
eight Open Spaces Jen's got 1 two 3 four
five so Jen's a little bit more
restricted of the type of of dice she
has to play here which is why she gets
five favor tokens whereas I only get
four now what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be playing over 10 rounds
and each round we're going to do a dice
draft where every player can potentially
grab two dice to add to their stained
glass design and by the end of the game
if every round you get two dice you will
have filled the thing out every space on
here that you don't fill out you lose
one point every favor you have left over
at the end of the game that you don't
use you gain one point and as well each
of us is going to get a secret objective
so these are all just try to focus on
one of the five colors so Jen and I both
get a secret objective that will
translate into points for that adhering
to it so me I want to make purple oh Jen
likes to have the purple one but purple
is my goal in this game and for Jen her
goal is yellow although that's secret I
don't know she's after yellow she
doesn't know I'm after purple although
if we can figure it out of course that
means we could try and snag those right
off from under our opponents so they
can't get them because this means every
purple d i Place gets me a point but
there are other ways to get points every
time you play there is there are 10
public objectives and you're going to
take three of them in this game we've
got light shades color variety and
column shade variety where you can get
four points for every set of colors you
know for every set of all five colors
you've got that's four points at the end
of the game and light shades uh dice
with a one or a two which are considered
to be the lighter Shades three and four
are medium Shades five and six are Dark
Shades so ones and twos for every set of
ones and twos you got that's two points
so you want a lot of ones and twos and
then also the column shap variety we
want our columns to ensure there's a
unique pip value in every space because
every column that has a unique pip value
scores four so I that's what we're
shooting for this game but you know it
could have been we were trying to go for
our diagonals or we're trying to go for
uh you know well a whole bunch of
different ones all right so those are
our goals and also as part of the random
setup there are three tools out here and
and these tools are what we use our
favors for that allow us to manipulate
the dice that we roll and of course
we've got the the brush the lens cutter
and the grinding stone but there's a
whole bunch more the strip cutter the
the the corkback straight edge the glit
blazing Hammer all of these let you
manipulate the dice in different ways
all right so we're set up we're ready to
go everybody has their secret objectives
and let's get going I am the first
player what you do on your turn you draw
uh dice equal to twice the number of
players plus one so in a two-player game
that means we're rolling five dice and
let's roll okay what do we get
so okay now right off the back remember
I want purple but no purples came out
purple all righty well but however a
couple of twos came out and remember
ones and twos sets of ones and twos are
a big deal so that means these ones and
twos are implicitly more valuable so I
am the first player I get to grab one of
these Dice and install it although man
this is kind of a bummer because I could
take one of these twos and now you can
see I've got some restrictions as to
where I can place stuff I can only place
fours here I can only place red dice
here I can only place yellow dice here I
can only place a here so if I want to
take this to I've got to put it in one
of my no restriction spaces but that's
kind of wasteful because you want to
save those for when you're up against a
wall and you're having a hard time
placing a die uh it's good to keep these
available but on the flip side these a
set of one and twos is worth two points
so what I will take one so the order is
going to be it's kind of a sneaking
order first player goes second player
goes third player goes and then third
player goes second player goes first
play player goes or in our case I'm
going to take one Jen's going to take
one then Jen's going to take another and
then I'm going to take one so every
round everybody gets a chance to get two
and there's always one left over so
anyway so I've taken one and now on your
turn you have two things you can take a
die and place it and if you want to you
can activate one of the stones so for
instance if I wanted to I could do the
grinding stone and take this two and
turn it into a five if I were so
inclined that's actually interesting I
could now well I mean I could take this
five and turn it into a two but um yeah
that there's just no reason to I'm
taking the two I'm not going to grind
the stone this brush allows me to move
one piece in my window to another space
while ignoring color restrictions so
that's a way later on if I use this uh
the the eglomise brush I'd be able to
take this two which is green and move it
say into this red space even though uh
it it breaks the color rules so I guess
I'm not considering the brushes out here
I'm not too terribly bothered that I've
kind of wasted one of my Open Spaces all
right so anyway so now Jen's going to
take one and remember Jen likes yellow
she's very happy to see two yellows out
there but there's also a two and I think
Jen's going to snag that too because if
she doesn't she knows I will because
we're both competing for ones and twos
so she'll take that and look at this
she's got a um now the first D you place
on your window has to come from the
outside edges you know any outside edge
space including the corners so you can't
just like jump directly to this two
space here Jen's going to come in from
the outside and fill up that green space
with a green D obviously she was
required to do that now Jen can take
another die and your first diee has to
come from the outside but every D after
that can be placed adjacent to any Dy
you've already got and that includes
diagonal adjacency so looking around
Jens she's got a pretty good plan here
she's going to go on ahead and take this
five
and place it diagonally adjacent to this
two and she has now filled up this
restricted two space or this restricted
yellow space and remember well she
scored a point for filling the space up
plus another point because it's yellow
and uh so she's pretty happy with that
now she's left two for me so I'm going
to take one I'll go on ahead and take
this yellow U because remember I have to
go off Jason so I've got two yellow
spaces to fill here so that'll be nice
I'll just go on ahead and fill this
yellow space all right there's always
one die left over every round it just
goes away and that is a reminder that we
have finished the first round once 10
dice have been placed up here that's how
we know we have finished 10 rounds of
the game and then we tally up to see who
wins so I was the first player I went
started now we the first player changes
Jen will be the first player in the
second round let's see what she pulls
and rolls all righty 1 two 3 four five
dice wow okay there's a green BL and
still no purple for me where are the
purples where are my purple people at
now Jen gets first di she'll take one
I'll take one and then another one and
then Jen will take one more and hey look
at this here's a one taking this Jen's
going to snag that she will put it here
adjacent to her existing ones in this
one space and now Jen's got a pair of
one and twos that's two more points she
scored she could also put it over here
if she wants but there's a problem in
addition to the restrictions you have to
pay attention to based on the card you
know the color and pip restrictions
there's another even more crushing
restriction you can never place a Dy of
the same color or the same value next to
an existing one so you can never place
um a two next to a two this would be
illegal for Jen to do she can't put a
two next to a two nor can she put a
yellow next to a yellow so that's a big
restriction you always have to work for
and if Jen took this blue and she might
say hey look I I can put it over here
and that fills up the one or I could
fill up this one or I could you know but
here's the problem Jen putting a blue
here means she has to put a blue here
and because she's put a blue here it's
impossible to put a blue there so she
would be basically ruining her chances
of finishing her stained glass window so
this would not be a good place to put it
she's going to put it over here although
she could put it over there as well well
that she'll just go on ahead and put
this over here because remember another
thing we're having to take into
consideration we get four points for
every column we have at the end of the
game that has unique values Jen now has
unique values a two and a three she
wants to put a four a five or a six in
these two spaces so she can get four
points for having column shade variety
another objective so anyway Jen grabb
that now I get to grab two and remember
I like purple but I don't see any purple
so what am I going to grab instead well
I would like to get some more ones and
twos the the last two here is a yellow
and unfortunately I can't put it here
because again a two can't go next to a
two I could take this yellow and I could
put it say like this that would be legal
cuz um the adjacency thing doesn't count
for diagonals I couldn't put it here
because you can't have a yellow next to
a yellow or a two next to a two but you
can have things diagonal adjacently so I
could do that and I've snagged another
two I don't have any ones yet so I'm
still not scoring any points for this
and again I'm being kind of wasteful
because if I take a yellow I re a yellow
two I really want to put it into a two
space or a yellow space face ah let's
see because well okay first of all I get
to take two so I think another thing
I'll take I'm going to ahead and take
this green five and put it here thereby
filling up that that uh five space that
could be trouble for me later I've got
that filled up and I'm going to take one
more and again I could take a yellow
here's the thing I one thing I won't do
is put a yellow here because then that
means I can't put a yellow here where
I'm required to am I going to take this
yellow and put it I could put it over
here now no I wouldn't want to do that
because then this yellow would be
blocked off so I could do
that oh but that's so wasteful but again
it's it's only partially wasteful
because I can move these dice around
although every time I use any of these
tools I have to pay my favors that means
I'm throwing away points to use the
tools so I don't want to use the tools
unless it's absolutely
essential and here's the thing if I
don't take this too I can look over and
I can see Jen well actually you know
what what would Jen do I don't think Jen
would want to take this to either the
only place she could put it legally
right now would be right here and that
would be no actually I'm sorry she can't
because she can't put a two next to a
two she can't put next to a yellow
actually Jen can't take this two at all
so if I don't take it I don't have to
worry that much about Jen taking it so
maybe I should take something that's
better for me although a three a
four and a
two I you know my my eight my my thing
doesn't want blues or greens at
all and I don't want threes or fours I
want a up here but I'd have to get this
space filled in first oh my gosh wow
well you know what I mean looking at
that
then what the heck I think I will go on
ahead and take the two might as well
because if I pick up some more ones
later it'll be worth it and no matter
what as it turned out with the way this
rolled I was going to have to use one of
my Norms anyway so back to Jen she gets
one more die and yeah easy peasy she's
going to take this and fulfill that blue
space without limiting the one or the
two or the purple she has to go there
and that was the end of the second round
okay my turn I want to see some purple
dice folks this is getting ridiculous
one two three four five okay one purple
die well I guess I that's got my name on
it I'm definitely going to want
that although oh my gosh come on game so
remember I want purples a purple finally
comes out and it's a four oh wait no no
that's fine cool cool cool oh but no
it's not fine I can put this here I can
expand off of this yellow and put it
here but here's my problem I want to
have color or shade variety a four and a
four in the same column means I have
given up the chance to get four bonus
points off this column by putting fours
in the same spot oh game man so anyway
I'm going to take one then Jen's going
to take two and I'm going to take one
more I want that purple so bad oh but I
want this one also because then I've got
a one and a two and that's two more
points but where am I going to put that
one well here's the thing though if I
don't take that one Jen's got the
perfect place for it so I got to take it
just so that Jen can't get it because
although Jen might take the purple she
might take the purple and put it right
there I may be giving up that purple but
you know what this one is worth a point
for filling up a space plus it's worth
two because I will have gotten the first
pair of light
shades all right well we'll do it we'll
do it we'll do it we'll do it we'll do
it oh my gosh I just also realized I put
a two and a two here in the same column
once again I have limited m
okay but I'm going to take this one
anyway and you know what I'm going to do
I am going to spend one of my favorites
on your turn you can take a die and you
can use one of the tools I'm going to
use this maneuver stuff I'm going to
move this
two oh wait no but I can't yet shoot I
want to move this two over here but you
can't I can't make a move that would
make this two off by itself away from
everything else so I can't do because I
wanted to put the one here because then
I'm taking care of my column shade
variety thing um but I can't do that I
could move this two no I can't move that
two over there because I I can only
ignore color restrictions not shade
restrictions anyway so I'm taking this
one where am I putting
it um I'm actually really restricted in
where I can put this
one you know on the flip side though you
know if I ignore the one and the purple
I could go on ahead and fill in this six
space which I need to fill I mean and
maybe I'm not going to find a six later
on there's a lot of options these are
all good but I think the main thing is I
don't want Jen to have that one cuz
that's just going to be too perfect for
her and my fingers are crossed I'm
hoping she won't take the
purple but why wouldn't she take the
purple of course she's going to take the
purple because she needs a purple well
but she also needs a red so she might
take that red instead but and you know
and she has no particular idea actually
if anything she's probably likely to
leave the purple because if she's paying
attention to me she knows I need that
six for this which if she takes that
then that'll leave me the purple but you
know what really what she's likely to do
she'll take the red and the purple
because she's going to take two back to
back and then that's going to leave me
with a four and a six although this
yellow six I could put here or here so I
would be able to or but I can't put a
yellow six here
ar oh tough choices this game I mean it
very quickly gets very interesting and
complex I'm going to take the one anyway
though just so I can get the light
shades and I'll go on ahead and put it
here or I put it there
yeah and then later on I will hopefully
um you know take care of this 2 two
thing although remember to do it I mean
I have to spend a point to make it the
interesting thing about the tools is
you're in kind of a race to use the
tools the first player to ever use a
tool only has to spend one favor but
from that point on anybody including the
original player who wants to use the
tools again that given tool has to use
two so tools get more expensive once
they've been used once so if you're
thinking at all about using a tool you
want want to use it sooner rather than
later let's see
here yeah okay I'll take that and now
let's see what Jen's going to do and you
know what I think as predicted very sad
for me Jen's going to take this purple
oh my purple and she's going to take
this oh wait oh hold on a second she
doesn't want this red because if she
puts this here putting a six that
prevents her from being able to put this
six here so she's not going to take that
or at least not
necessarily H so I mean she could take
see on the flip
side she could go on ahead and take this
six and now she could still put illegal
red there later I think that's what
she's going to do and I'm like oh my
gosh surprise the six got left for me
hooray I'll take that awesome okay and
then that was round three Jen's turn
rolling five dice one two three four
five oh and finally it is the turn of
the
purples so Jen's going to take one one
and I'm going to take two and Jen's
going to take one no ones or twos came
out very interesting okay so nobody's
chasing after the lades although again
they kind of did because the first
player to use the grinding stone can
turn a six into a one or can turn a five
into a two and that might be worth
throwing a point away to be able to do
that particularly because Jen needs a
two and a one right there so that's
actually pretty cool that's pretty cool
I think yeah Jen is going to be the
first to use the grinding stone and she
will
turn this
yeah she will turn this six into a
one no she will I'm sorry she will turn
this five into a two and put it here
because if she turned the six into a one
and put it here she would have messed up
her
multicolor what's it called the column
shade the column shade variety wait no
no she can have the same color it's
different numbers you want different
numbers right right right so well she
could have gone either way but you know
that's okay she still went with that all
right so now I'm going to take
two and what am I going to do I want
this six remember I want purples I want
this six to come over here to fill in
this purple space just so I can get that
done which means I need to put something
in one of again I'm just kind of wasting
these easy
spaces but what the heck I will do it
and I will
put
the okay I'll take this blue five and
I'll put put it here can't put it there
because it's next to a five but I'll put
it there and now that got me reach over
here to put my purple in all right and
so now Jen's taking one more and you
know what o I wasn't even paying
attention to this but Jen wants to fill
this red space but here's a four here's
a five that means you can't put a four
or five in that red space she needs to
put um or a six she needs to put a red
one two or three into that space if she
ever wants to fill it in and score a
point for it but in the meantime Jen's
still happy to have these left over
she'll go ahead and take this red five
and put it right here she didn't want to
put the red four because then that would
mess up this four all right round four
is over round
five uh one two three four i d six one
one two three four
five all right oh wow look at that folks
it's a perfect storm it's a purple and
it's a one that is what I want um
because then I'll have my second pair of
ones and twos and I'll have another
purple although I don't have any
specific purple spaces to fill but still
I can't let this go
now where am I going to put this I want
to put this remember I'm going for
Unique numbers in rows well heck the
only place I can put it is here although
then um and you know I could do this if
I want to give up on having unique pip
values in this row then I could put it
here that's the easy peasy thing to do
or if I want to still spend to move
stuff around then I should go on ahead
and put it over in this row I'll do that
and now that's giving me access to being
able to build on both of those all right
so that my first now Jen remember uh Jen
like yellow so she's eyeballing this
yellow three and which she will put down
here nice filled up that and she wants
one more and remember I was saying she
wanted a red one to her three she got it
although oh no if she puts a red three
here and there's a three here once again
she's given up on column shade
variety which is four points so she puts
that there where else I mean she doesn't
oh no here's the problem if she puts any
if she puts a red three here at all then
she can never get shade variety so that
means she really has to hold out for a
red one or two in this space and what
are the chances that's going to
happen you know Jen could try to flip
this but then it's a four and she can't
put it next to a
four she wants this but does she dare
take that chance or does she give up on
the four no she's going to take a chance
and instead she'll take something else
she'll take well she'd love to take this
and put it here but then that messes up
this this six space so that's no good
good is that green any good for her yeah
she'll go ahead and take this green and
put it right there okay so that's fine
she can still build in both of those
spaces and so now she's left me
one and what do I want to do oh I got a
lot of red spaces to fill so I think
I'll take this and I think I'll just go
on ahead and put it right here because
that's legal for the numbers it's legal
for the colors and I've still got my
chance of oh man I just realized I put a
four here that means I can't put a all I
think I did right anyway so that was
round
five round six one two three
four no purples for me there's some
yellows for red though Jen is definitely
happy about that let's see what is she G
to
do um all right she still got that red
to fill she wants a red one or two there
that didn't come out for
her and of course you know as you go
longer and longer it's just going to get
trickier and tricker and this board is
going to get Tighter and Tighter I think
Jen's going to take this yellow five CU
she loves yellow she needs fill out that
five and she hasn't messed up that
column that's leaves two for me I need a
four to fill up this space let's go
ahead and take this red
four although but if I put a red four
here I can't put a red there if I all
right well let's go ahead and put it in
this red space because that's tot legit
and now I get one
more and hey you know what I've got this
yellow I need to fill this yellow and
this yellow this would be totally legal
so that's cool let's go with that
and yeah and so okay so although oh I
left a one I left a one do I want Jen to
have a one
no but you know what uh can she if she
takes it she's just going to put it
right here look how perfect that is for
her and that would give her so that that
means she's got a one and a two and
another one and a two so we are tied up
on the light Shad race because I've got
a one and a two and I've got a one and a
two I can't let her have that one but
look how perfect that yellow is and I
need to fill that yellow space in I this
might be my only chance to fill that
yellow
space Oh goodness gracious now I'm Gonna
Fill it I'm just going to do it and yeah
Jen is going to take that one boom
Perfect all right so that lift that on
to round seven one two three four five
hey look at here some
purple Jen says no yellow so sad okay
I want this purple because it's bonus
points to me I have no three so again
I'm going to have to use one of my
existing spaces I can't put it here here
because this purple I could I could
totally legally put this right here
because there's no threes there's no
purples and you know and this was
getting to be a tougher and tougher
space to
fill that's not bad okay let's go with
that although what am I giving up
here I giv up any of
these ah cuz that's a four which no I
can't put that four there
I could put that four up here though Jen
has no but I mean this is a tough space
to fill I'm pretty happy I got that fill
so we'll go with it let's see what Jen's
going to do all right she has no blues
or but okay she does have this four
space
so yeah I think she's GNA snag that blue
which I wanted and I let her have it
boom and what else is Jen gonna do Jen
will you know what I think Jen's going
to spend two more points
to turn this six into a one and fill
this space it's a unique color it's a
unique number it's another one for a one
two so she just threw two points away to
get this one point filled up here but J
that's another one so Jen also has a
chance if another two comes along she'll
get two points to make up for the stuff
she's lost so she's going to go for that
and that leaves me with one left over
and what can I
do I could go on ahead and put this four
right here that looks pretty legit all
right there we go that's fine oh boy
it's getting tighter folks let's see
what Jen's going to come up with 1 2 3
four five
dice all
right right oh hey look Jen's been
waiting for it there's that red too
she's been waiting for perfect okay so
that gives me two things and I like
purple yes I do I like purple how about
you let's go on ahead and put it right
right here no I can't I can't put it a
purple next to a purple I can't put this
purple next to
anything I can't I because I can't put
it there because purple is killing me I
can't put the purple I canot oh so sad
so sad oh all right well this moving on
don't uh don't live in the past there
buddy this is interesting okay I was
thinking about before I could do it now
if I use this to move this two out of
here here over here and fill up that
space I could then take this yellow five
and fill this space in and boom I spent
a point but I gained Four Points by
making this a perfect column that was
pretty good pretty good and this is a
perfect column as well yay now I still
want to move this yellow over
here so that I can put something else so
I can have four perfect columns and
that's going to cost me two points but I
can only use a given tool once per turn
so anyway after all that I'm going to
take one more and if I'm thinking
eventually I'm going to move this yellow
over here then I don't want to put this
red
four although you know what there's a
red four and a four and if I move this
other four I could just totally give up
on this column for having unique numbers
but still have a chance for that column
over
there or hey I just pulled another four
I could fulfill this requirement as well
while no I can't because I can't put a
green next to a green I can't do that
that would be tote
[Music]
cheating
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah let's go on
ahead and take that four and eventually
I'm going to move this four over here
and I just I'm giving up on this but I
still got hopes for this column and this
column right so that leaves two for Jen
and what's she going to do this green
she can't put any of these spaces she
could put the green up there she can't
put it there no she can't put this green
any place because it's a four it's
blocked off there it's a green it's
blocked locked off there although if she
spent two more and turned it into a
three she'd have options so
alternatively it's this purple she can't
put the purple in either of these but
she could put the purple anywhere down
here so Jen's taking the purple and um
she wants it to be she doesn't want to
put it here because then that messes up
the unique numbers for this she'll put
it right here she's finished that column
there we go that was round eight two
more rounds folks oh it's coming down to
the wire 1 two 3 four
five Bippity B boo all
righty so now this is when I will use my
brush again to slide this over here that
column is done it's it's useless there's
three fours in there so I've totally
given up on column variety but now that
means I could take this yellow which
unbeknownst to me hurts Jen because she
loves yellow and now if I can just get a
four over here if I as long as I can get
a four in here I've done it I have
finished this column perfect although
that means I just threw this purple away
but you know what I couldn't put this I
couldn't put the purple here or here or
there anyway so the purple wasn't going
to do me any good so I'm pretty happy
with that now Jen's going to take two
I've given her a wide variety of stuff
if she takes this one and this two
that's another light shade bonus can she
do
it um she totally can she could put this
one say over
here and oops that was a one and that
means that column's fine that's all
totally legal and then can she put this
to someplace she can't put it there or
there or there Jen cannot put that to
any
place
shoot um but she takes one more she
could take this purple five and put it
down there and she has completed another
perfect unique value column she's happy
with that she's left one for me and hey
this is my chance to get a two but I
can't put it there I can't put it there
I can't put it there because of the
green the the number and the all those
restrictions I can't use that too either
but you know what I there's one tool I
have yet to use I think I'm going to use
it no no am I going to use it right now
see the last tool the lens cutter would
let me take either of these put them up
in the countdown and pull so I could
pull this blue five out or this blue
four out and get a perfect off of this
and here's the thing I only have one
favor left if Jen goes here before I do
then I can't use my last favor so this
might be my last chance to use it but
here's the thing if I don't use it I
could push my luck and hope that next
round a four comes out that I could use
but you know Jen's going to be first and
the last round if a four comes out
she'll see that she can put a four here
and keep it for me I'm not taking the
chance I'm going to use the lens cutter
and so I'm going to take this this two
let's say no because I don't want to put
a two out here that Jen could grab using
the lens cutter I'm going to use this
six to bring this four and I've done it
so I spent a point to gain a point but
more importantly I gained four points
last round here we go this is for all
the marbles and Jen still has two tools
she could two favors that's two points
or she could use any of the tools for
this last round and let's see what we
got remember Jen loves yellows we both
love ones and twos we're both trying to
get these these columns what does Jen
want um she can't put a one or two here
she can put a one here so she could take
this and boom finish that and now
uh one two three six so she can only put
a four or a six here there is a six
there is a six and there's four so Jen's
pretty confident she's going to get that
so she filled that
space and um now it's my turn I've got
two spaces to fill and I I will these
work will these work will these work
will okay this red I can't put this red
there be or because it's a six I can't
put a six next to a six this purple I
can't put the purple anywhere cuz I got
my two purples these are both dead to me
this six I could put this six up here
all right and this two oh my gosh folks
look at that
perfect look at that nice all right Jen
this is her final so she can put a six
into this space and she will do so this
doesn't mess up there's no restrictions
there's no sixes next to it there's no
Reds that's it game over final tally
time okay well we both both got a
perfectly filled out stained glass
window so we both score 20 points right
right off the bat Jen has two favors
left over so she's in the lead 20 to 22
and so now I reveal I like purple yes I
do so I got three
purples so that's three more points
coming my way uh let's see here how am I
going to keep track of all that we'll
just use some more of these favor tokens
all right so I just pulled three for my
purples Jen she reveals I yellow 1 two 3
four oh that's four points for Jen scary
all right so effectively at this point
Jen's W the lead it comes down to these
let's look at the light shades pairs of
ones and twos here's a pair all right
that's actually I mean so actually we
don't need to keep the all right so
there's a
pair there's a pair did I get any more
ones no I only got two ones so that was
two pairs so so um that is that's four
more
points 1 two three four all right and
how did Jen do for pairs one one a one a
one that's four ones five ones she got
five ones but how many twos did she get
one two wow she even though she got all
these ones she only got two twos I kind
of lost track of that is that true
there's only two twos in here yep so Jen
also got two
pair the game my understanding is the
game will actually come with a little
score p pad and pencil you can use to
keep track of stuff I think I'm not
really quite sure I'm not quite sure
what the final scorekeeping is the rules
don't say um heck I could just use dice
I could just easily just use dice to
keep track of what the final score is
but anyway so last one column shade
variety oh but crap I shouldn't have
pulled these apart oh dear that was very
important
oh ah okay can I reconstruct this I if I
recall correctly this is the only one I
didn't have right right because oh dummy
oh you're such a dummy what did I do
yeah there's a purple up here and
there's a yellow here and there I think
it was like that I think this is what it
was so I've got this is not variety
there's variety here two three four I
got four
variety um yep so that is 16 points how
did Jen do one no variety
here two
three four so Jen got four variety I got
four variety Jen was already in the lead
so Jen takes it folks and that was one
full playthrough of sagata and now if
you'd like to hear some final thoughts
you can hit the eye on the top right
corner screen or follow the show notes
in five four 3 two 1

TRANSCRIPCIÓN:
welcome to Jong Gates games today I'll
be doing a full three-player playthrough
of cigara in this game players will be
constructing a colorful stained glass
window in front of themselves by
drafting color Dice from a central pool
these dice must go down in front of them
according to a variety of restrictions
and they will also be trying to match
several public objectives that everybody
is shooting for I'll explain how the
game actually plays while we're playing
it so let's jump in here we have our
game fully set up for our three players
we'll be playing the game for the
perspective of the purple player over
here I've already done several pieces of
setup the most important being that each
player has chosen a window pattern that
they've slid into their frame we each
got two of these double-sided cards to
choose from at the beginning of the game
and then once we picked one we got to
see down here the number of little dots
this is how many favorite tokens we
start at the beginning of the game we
see that blue has five we have four and
red has three and these are correlated
with the difficulty of the pattern
itself so this pattern over here is
easier than this one which is why the
blue player got a couple more of these
tokens and we're going to spend these
tokens over here on these tools which
let us do various cool things as we
place Dice and move them around on our
little patterns we also have three
public objectives that were randomly
dealt out and lastly each of us was
given a private objective we see that
ours is blue this says that we're going
to get victory points at the end of the
game that equal the sum total of Pips on
all the blue dice in our window we'll be
going first and so what we do is we grab
this big dice bag and we're going to
pull out seven Dice and then we're going
to roll them since we rolled the dice we
are first to pick and I think that what
we should do is take this blue five
right here and put it down into our
window now the first die that we put
down must go into one of the perimeter
spots and there are a couple uh Cardinal
rules as we're playing the game the
first is that when we put the D down it
has to match the shade of the pattern so
if I want to put this blue Dy down here
that's fine because it's blue also the
PIP value has to match if there is one
on your board so for instance I could
not put this here because that says six
and this is a five I think let's go
ahead and take this blue five uh this is
good for us because well it blocks over
that spot also we know that our private
objective is blue so this is five points
at the end of the game for us and I
think that's a pretty good place for us
to start we now move to the blue player
and they've decided to take one of these
red fives and they're going to put it
down right here it's on the perimeter so
that's fine and now moves over to the
red player and they've decided to grab
this yellow six and they're going to put
it down right into this matching six
location and now they're going to grab
another die because the way this works
is we actually have a snake draft where
we picked one blue picked one Red's
going to pick two and then it goes back
to blue and then finally comes back to
us so the red player grab this yellow
four and they want to put it down right
here and at this point it's good to talk
about a couple more rules the first is
that whenever you place a new die down
onto your window it has to be
orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a
previous die that you have also there
are two Cardinal rules of the game
you're never allowed to have two dice of
the same color orthogonally adjacent to
each other and you're never allowed to
have two dice of the same pit value
orthogonally adjacent to each other but
diagonal is just fine this also brings
us to a good point to discuss these
public objectives this first one right
here is going to give any game points
for having diagonally adjacent dice of
the same color and this is probably part
of the reason why the red player decided
they want to put this yellow d right
here because now this is effectively a
two-point play for the end game because
they have two yellow dice that aren't
diagonally adjacent we are also going to
get two points at the end of the game
for every pair of one and two value dice
in our entire window though positioning
does not actually matter and lastly
we'll get five points for every column
we have in our window that doesn't have
two dice with the same color for
probably much the same reason as the red
player blue decides to grab this five
and they're going to put it right down
here so it is also diagonally adjacent
to a red it's now finally come back to
us and we have to pick one of these two
dice right here and I think that we
should grab this one part of the reason
for that is because it's half of a
potential pair for some endgame points
from this public objective and also
because it works out relatively well by
placing right here this is a green
forced shade spot right here and also if
we look at the PIP values around this
one we have a three a five and a two so
that means we're not actually
conflicting we wouldn't want to put
something down that would Conflict for
instance if we had taken this purple
four and put it here we would have a
problem because we need to put a four
right here and you can never have two
dice of the same value so we're not
going to choose this one and with that
the round is over there's always going
to be at least one die remaining and
we're going to take this one and put it
up here onto the round tracker to show
that round one is done and we can now
move into round two we now hand the dice
bag to the blue player and they're going
to pull out seven Dice and roll these
blue starts It Off by grabbing this red
six and they're going to put it right
down here in the bottom middle of their
window red likes the look of this green
four and they're going to put it down
right onto this four spot for our first
pick I think we should grab this red
five right here uh first of all because
it works out relatively well for our
little pattern because we get to match
the five right there but also because we
have a sneaking suspicion that it's
possible that the blue players hidden
goal is red considering the only dice
that they've taken so far are red and
all high value so grabbing this means
it's not in the pool for the a blue pair
to potentially grab on their next turn
and for our second grab let's go ahead
and take this four because it matches
our private goal which is blue so this
is four points to us right away and
let's go ahead and I guess maybe put it
over here so that we have the ability to
chain off in a diagonal over there with
a blue if we put this here then right
from the gecko that's not great we'd
kind of like to put a red down there uh
and also it's jent to something that
needs to be a two and that's no big deal
for us I wouldn't want to put it over
here because then we'd have two Blues in
the same column and then we would lose
out on Five Points at the end of the
game it's back to the red player and
they decide to grab this yellow six and
they'll plug it down right there and
lastly blue decides to grab this yellow
five and they'll put it right there the
green five is the remainder so we'll put
it up onto the track and we can now move
into the third round of the game we'll
pass the die bag to the red player
they're going to pull seven out and roll
them red of course gets the first grab
and they're going to take this blue two
right here which is of course half of a
set for this endgame objective for
getting two points and they're going to
put it right into the bottom middle of
their board is now our turn to grab and
there are two good Blues available and
of course we could pick a different
color dice but blue is much more
attractive to us and right from the
get-go this five looks great because
it's worth five points at the end of the
game but the problem is that we don't
actually have any legal place to put it
on our board at the moment because right
here would be Blues next to each other
right here we would have fives next to
each other and the same thing goes for
these locations up here and of course we
can't put that there because it's yellow
so unfortunately we cannot actually uh
place this die down although if we
really wanted to we could activate this
tool up here now let's go ahead and take
a look and see the details of this it's
says it is a uh grossing pliers and it
says that after you draft you can
increase or decrease the value of the
drafted die by one and the way you
activate these is by taking favor tokens
and putting them down onto the cards the
first time either of these tools is
taken it just costs one favorite token
and every subsequent pull costs two of
these tokens but each token is also
worth one point at the end of the game
so I think at the moment it does not
make sense to sacrifice a point just to
be able to flip this over to something
else and put it as a diagonal when we
could grab this one which is half of a
pair to get two points at the end of the
game and we can put it down right here
where it's going to be diagonally
adjacent to this four so at least that
is a two-point turn and then half of two
points over here blue now gets to pick
two dice they're going to start with
this yellow one and they're going to put
it right here oops I knocked this die
over right here and for their other pick
they're going to grab this purple four
and they'll slide it down over here it's
our turn again and I think that we do
actually want to activate one of these
tools now you can use these either
before or after you grab these dice
depending on the actual power of the
specific tool and for us I think we want
to go first instead of doing this one
I've already shown I think let's go
ahead and activate this one over here
it's called a egom brush and it says
that we can move any one die in our
window and we can ignore the color
restriction that is on our window
pattern of course we do have to obey all
of the regular placement restrictions as
I mentioned before the first time one of
these tools is activated it only costs
one favorite token so we can put this
over here and then we can grab this blue
five which we placed at the very
beginning of the game and put it over on
top of this purple spot which leaves us
open to grab this blue five over here
which is also great because it's five
points at the end of the game and we can
put it down into that previous location
and we have the bonus of having diagonal
Blues of course this costs us one point
by losing the favorite token but we
gained two points by having this
diagonal set and we might even be able
to make it longer so I think this was a
good idea also it's nice to activate
these before our opponents do because
it's cheaper right now lastly the red
player grabs the red two they're going
to put it right down here and with that
the round is over we can take this
purple five and put it up at the top of
the round track and I think this is
actually a pretty good time to explain
our third and final tool option this one
right here is called a lens cutter and
it says that after you draft you can
actually swap the die you just drafted
with one of the dice on the round track
so that means that these dice over here
are not actually technically completely
out of the game we may pull one or two
of them back to actually fit them into
our board as we continue playing the
game the red player has handed us back
the die bag we're going to pull out
seven dice we got a whole bunch of red
right here and we will roll them we get
first pick and I think despite having
all these red dice there's lots of Pips
on them let's go ahead and take this red
five and we'll put it over into our top
Corner the blue player not
unsurprisingly is grabbing this red five
and they're going to stick it in the
middle of their top column red now gets
to grab two of them they're going to
start with this purple two right over
here and then they're going to grab this
purple five and they'll put it right in
the middle of all the rest of these blue
gets grab dice again and they're going
to get one of these red threes and
they're going to put it right over here
they have a nice big diagonal thing
going on right here and lastly it comes
back to us and I figure let's go ahead
and grab this green four and well we
could put over here in this four spot
but let's go ahead and stick it right
there so then we have a little bit of a
diagonal starting with that we've ended
the round the dice bag gets passed to
the blue player and they're going to
roll seven dice blue gets first pick and
they're going to take one of these green
ones and put it right into this Green
Spot Red's going to continue their
zigzag of yellows by putting the five
right here and now we get to grab two of
these and there's just no way we can
pass up a blue six we'll put it right
over here so we have a really nice
diagonal happening and we may as well
take this yellow three and put it into
this yellow spot just because well we
have to put a yellow there at some point
this is a reasonable opportunity we
already have a couple one value dice so
we're actually looking for two value
dice so there's no strong reason to grab
either of these red likes the look of
this red one and they're going to put it
in their top left corner cor and lastly
the blue clayer grabs yet another red Dy
and they put it down into the corner
that finishes off round five we can put
this green one up to the top red now
takes the dice bag and they're going to
roll all
these they're going to grab this yellow
five right here and finish off the
zigzag it's now time for us to grab one
of these and I think we're very
incentivized to grab this purple too
that's because we already have two ones
out on our board and we have zero twos
at this point also this purple two fits
really nicely into the spot that must be
a two anyway so I think we should go
ahead and do this it completes one of
our potential at the moment two possible
sets we'll be more interested in these
one value dice once we get at least one
more two blue gets to grab two they are
going to grab this red four put it right
over there and then this purple four
down into the corner and now it comes
back to us and it looks like we have to
take a one value die and I see no reason
not to take this purple one and stick it
right over there it's got to be a one
anyway and it fits pretty nicely for the
moment lastly the red player doesn't
really have a choice here they have to
take a green one and they're going to
put it down into this green shaded spot
right there that's going to finish out
the six round of the game it's our turn
to grab the d bag and roll a bunch of
dice the first thing we notice is there
is a blue two and I kept saying that we
wanted to have another two so we can
make a pair but another thing to notice
is that we have a blue in all five of
our columns now and we would really like
to not have any duplicates within a
column because then we'd be losing Five
Points the blue player has lots of red
dice already but they already have a
couple columns where that is not going
to be the case although they could spend
some of their favorite tokens to move
some dice around before the game ends it
does seem to me that this red three
works out pretty well for us though we
could put it right over here you can see
this must be a three anyway and it gives
us a little diagonal that we're already
working towards so I think that's going
to be a pretty good pick for us Blue's
going to grab this two over here and
they're going to place it right there
red gets to grab two and they're going
to take this green four and then this
purple five right here and you may have
noticed that we're not using these tools
too much just yet in fact only one has
been activated so far and in general
these happen much more in the late game
when it becomes much harder for us to
actually take the dice that are
currently rolled and fit them in within
our uh patterns because we've just
become much more restricted blue decides
to grab this green four and they'll
slide it in right there completing their
bottom row and we've got to take a red
five or a red one and I think we should
take the five because we can plug it
right down here we'll get a longer
diagonal bonus and we can't actually put
the one there because he'd be clashing
with that other one ones do seem nice in
general but I think adding to a diagonal
is probably the better thing for us to
do right now and with that we can take
this guy put it up here and that ends
the seventh round and we can move into
eight blue now grabs the bag and they
pull out wow a lot of yellow Dice and
they roll
them blue decides to grab this yellow
one and put it into this yellow shaded
spot on their window Red's going to grab
this blue blue four and put it on this
blue shaded spot right here and that
leaves us with a mess of yellows and a
single blue to play with uh of course a
blue six looks great but once again by
placing this down somewhere on our board
we're going to be sacrificing five
points for potentially not having any
duplicate uh dice colors so I think we
should probably start and grab this
yellow six right here and we could put
it there on our board and you know what
let's take the other yellow six and we
can slide it right over here we had a
couple different options we can make
work there's not a huge strategic
advantage to putting it here but it does
fit things relatively well of course
we'd love to have more Reds to make
diagonals but we would actually be able
to put a red here so I think all in all
we're pretty happy with that red grabs
the blue six and they put it in the
bottom right hand side of their board
and finally blue will grab this yellow
three and slide in right over here as
you can see there are not many spots
left over and this ends the eighth round
we have two more to go but it's going to
become much harder to actually find
valid dice to stick in and I'm sure
we're going to be hitting some of these
tools soon to make decent plays for
ourselves red now grabs this dice bag
which is getting significantly lighter
as we pull all these out and they roll a
lot of sixes they decided to grab this
purple two and they put it in their
middle row we're pretty bummed about
that we were really hoping to be able to
grab this die and punk it down right
over here and make a little diagonal but
that's not going to happen so this goes
right there in the middle but one of
these purple sixes is almost as good the
two would have been good because it
paired up with one of our ones for two
points but we can slide this over here
anyway and we still at least get our
diagonal and we've locked in another row
that has no duplicate colors the blue
player gets to grab two dice they'll
start by taking this four and sliding it
over there and for the second die
they're going to take this green four
but before they place it down they're
going to take one of their favorite
tokens and they're going to put it over
here onto the grossing pliers this
allows them to increase or decrease the
value of the die they just drafted so
they'll take this four turn it into a
three and they're going to put it down
right over here
looking at these three options we don't
actually have a legal move for any of
them uh mostly because they're all sixes
and we look at our board we see that we
can't put a six here we can't put a six
here and we can't put a six here because
this needs to be a four so I think what
we should do is spend one of our favors
and again these are one point at the end
of the game so we're losing a point by
doing this but let's use the last of the
uh tools that has not been used just yet
and let's take this purple six and we
can swap it out with this purple four
that is on the round tracker and we can
easily put this purple four down into
this slot here that works out really
well for us cuz it means that for our
last two grabs of the game they are they
don't have any specific restrictions on
them and we got another little diagonal
going and then red obviously takes one
of these yellow sixes and they don't
decide to use any tools they're just
going to put it down right over here
with that round number nine is done and
the dice bag comes back to us for the
last round of the game we'll roll all
these Dice and now we get to choose one
let's go ahead and grab this red two
this is going to work out pretty well
for us because we can slide it in right
here it's going to pair up with one of
the ones that we have to gain us two
points at the end of the game and we
there are still two purples out within
this dipol and hopefully one of them
will be available to us uh with our last
pick so we can slide it in right to this
last spot on our board the blue players
last two spots are a six and a two and
they've had to do a little bit of
thinking and they've decided to grab
this three then they're going to spend
two of their favors because once again
after one of these tools is taken every
future use cost two favors they'll put
it down on here they're going to
decrease this three down to a two
they'll put it in right over here which
works pretty nicely because they now
made a diagonal of two on their window
for Red's First grab they're going to
take one of these green ones and slide
it into the bottom left corner and with
their other grab they'll take this other
green one and they are going to spend
two of their favorite tokens they're
going to put it down onto the lens
cutter up here so they can swap it with
the red three and put that down onto
their board so they've completed their
board
and now comes back to the blue player
and they actually don't have any plays
whatsoever because when you look at
their board they have one of each of the
four out of the five colors surrounding
this six which means this must be blue
and since it's printed on the board
needing a six they would need a blue six
and there are no blue sixes over here
and no blue sixes amongst the dice on
the round tracker so that means that
they're just going to pass and they will
have one empty slot in their window for
the end of the game and finally it comes
to us for the last die grab of the game
and I know I went on and on earlier in
this round saying that I was hoping a
purple would survive but I was
forgetting that we already have a purple
in this column and we get five points if
we don't have any duplicates in that
column so this is actually a pretty poor
play for us I think what we should
instead do is well we can take this one
right here but while we're doing this
let's grab our last two favor tokens and
we are going to put these down onto the
lens cutter uh so you don't have to
increase as soon as some one person puts
down it's always two for the rest of the
game and we can swap this with one of
the green ones we we're certainly hoping
to grab the green one that the red
player decided to take instead and we
can slide this in over here it does not
give us any diagonal bonuses but it does
mean that we were able to get all five
of our columns to have no duplicates at
all and with that the final round of the
game is over we have more than one die
available and that happened because the
blue player wasn't able to grab so both
of these actually go up onto that one
slot on the round tracker and at this
point we can shift into endgame scoring
we no longer care about any of these
tools and we no longer care about the
round tracking so we can dump all of the
dice flip this over and now we have a
handy dandy scoreboard to total up all
the points we were able to make
throughout the game let's go ahead and
begin with these public objectives so
the first one is diagonal scoring again
it's one point per die that is
diagonally adjacent to another D of its
color so looking over at our area we see
that we have one two for these two
purples 3 four for the greens 5 six for
the blues 7 8 n for these Reds 10 11 12
for these blues and 13 14 for these
purples so we can take our purple
scoring chip and put it down on 14 next
up we have the blue player and they have
one two for these purples 3 four 5 6
seven eight for these Reds 9 10 for the
greens and 11 12 13 for the
yellows and now we have the red player
they have one two for the greens 3 four
five six for Purple 7 8 9 10 11 for
yellow then 12 13 14 for blue so between
the three of us we all got very similar
scores for that public objective and
next up we each get two points for each
pair of one and two we have in our
entire window we were only able to do
this two times because we have four ones
but only two twos so that's going to be
four points for us bringing us up to 18
the blue player was able to balance us
out really well with three ones and
three twos so that's going to be six
points for them bringing them from 13 up
to
19 and it looks like red was able to do
the same with 3 ones and 3 tws so they
go from 14 up to
20 the third and final public objective
was not having any dup colors within a
column we were able to do all five of
those so that's 5 Time 5 or 25 points
for us and that brings us all the way up
to 43 blue is only able to do this three
times because of these two duplicate
Reds in these rows so that's going to be
15 points which brings them up to 34 and
the red player was able to do this four
times with just the duplicate yellows in
this one column so that's going to be 20
points bringing them up to
40 it's now time for us to score our
private objectives we'll go ahead and
start with blue when we add up all the
Pips on the blue dice we get 21 more
points which brings us up to 64 so we
can flip our disc over to the 50 side
and now we get to see if the blue player
was indeed going for Reds and yes they
were when all of these red dice are
added together they gain 27 points which
is going to bring them up to 61 and only
three points behind us and lastly we can
take a look and see what the red player
had they were going for
yellows wow when you add all of these up
they got 32 points from this private
objective so that's going to bring them
all the way up to 72
points next up we all score one point
for each favorite token we have left
over we obviously have none the blue
player has two so that's going to bring
them up to 63 and the red player has one
left over so that brings up up to 73
lastly each player is going to lose one
point for every open space in their
windows but the blue player was the only
one to have any they just have one so
that brings them down to 62 and with
that we are done with all of the scoring
our final scores are 62 for blue 64 for
us and the red player has won by a
decent margin with 73 points and that
completes a full game of
Sagrada well I hope you enjoyed this
playthrough my main goal here was to try
and show the variety of things that are
going through a player's mind while
they're trying to figure out not only
which die to grab from the pool but also
where to put that die down into their
stained glass window that they are
forming they have to think not only
about the uh short-term ramifications of
putting this down there are going to be
many restrictions and only so many spots
you can actually put this die down into
the window but also what the
ramifications of that decision are in
the future because uh just because you
have a legal placement right now with
this D does not mean it's something that
you should do because maybe you now have
an illegal spot next to it you know you
have a restriction you can only put a
three pip down here and you put a
regular three right here now that's
either going to be an empty space at the
end of the game or you're going to have
to spend points uh in the form of those
favor tokens in order to use the tools
which can kind of rejigger things around
on your stained glass window and
obviously you cannot uh plan entirely
for the future and it's uh interesting
that you do have those tools out there
as an option to mess around with your
previous uh decisions or perhaps the
previous mistakes but either way you
have all these different things that
you're thinking about uh each turn and
uh even though it just comes down to
grabbing one die from the middle and
putting it down into this stained glass
window that you're making so I think
that wraps up pretty much all of my
thoughts on this specific playthrough as
always I'd like to thank everyone who's

TRANSCRIPCIÓN:
hi my name is Jennifer nix I'm back at
the ice cup for this evening I'm joined
by Matt and we've just finished playing
sagrada now i think this is named after
these sagrada família some church in
spain and your building sort of
stained-glass windows within the church
you're picking from a selection of dice
each turn and you've got to put them in
here to make nice colorful displays you
can see there's a complete one that
Steve's at the end of the previous game
but you're trying to do them in certain
ways kind of rules about what numbers
for instance you can only put 5s on the
five spots only blue dice will go on the
blue starts why it will take anything
which is quite handy in terms of how you
get points though because at the end of
the game you're going to score depending
on how well you fill this you have a
secret objective so in this case we're
trying to get as many blue dice as I
could so these are quite good in fact
you this little thing at the start here
slides out so you actually get a choice
of which starting grid you want so I
might look at this and go oh yes I need
blues so I'm gonna pick one's got lots
of Blues in but then each time we've
sort of each round the first player will
roll some dice and you pick one so I
might pick this five and to start with
it has to go on the edge so I could put
that there and then everyone else goes
round and they pick a dice and the last
person picks two dice and it comes all
the way back round to me if I was first
player so at this point I'm looking for
blue dice that there aren't any blue
dice I'll just take this red - now you
can't put numbers next to each other and
you can't put colors next to each other
so I couldn't put yellow next to this
one and I couldn't about a 5 next to
this one even if it would be sort of
legally allowed here so this red to
those fine I'm gonna put this here cuz
now it gives me more options for where I
can place dice they've got to be
adjacent to the previous ones you've
placed so that's that I mean there's an
awful lot of restrictions in this game
in terms of what colors get an extra -
what numbers the actual spaces on here
being connected so you've really got to
think each time now if you find you sort
of end up looking at the ice and going I
just can't place anything so also these
special abilities that you're looking
for here so in this game this gives you
an option to reroll the dice this one
lets you flip the dice you've just
picked onto his opposite side and this
one lets you place the dice that's not
adjacent in order to use these though
you've got to spend these sort of joules
you start with a certain number of them
and you kind of spend them as you go
the game and then finally in terms of
scoring as well as getting points for
the number of pips on blue dye so I'd
add up all the pips on all my blue dice
in this game and it's variable each time
we were getting points for having
different numbers in each column so you
can't have the same number in a column
pairs of five and sixes and then
different colors in each column
but these as I say a difference who does
that variety each time you play but as
the most points at the end of the winner
what do you think this is a lovely
implementation around some of blueprints
which is another game I like about you
trying to hope that certain colored dice
of the right numbers courts that you can
fit when you go very well
like Johnson said the so many
restrictions the adjacency restrictions
then color restrictions the restriction
is you've got on your own board you can
place diagonally adjacent to when you're
filling your border but with all those
other restrictions and then the point
scoring restrictions as well so not
really enough it it on oh it's something
US government anything or whatever you
know you need lose points of you I've no
holes at the end but trying to fill
those as well so the very first game I
played I fill my board but I didn't
focus on the points I didn't focus on
what actually got me points and that
extra restriction just kind of goes whoa
and yeah it's really nice and you kind
of draft them clockwise anti-clockwise
whoever gets the first pick gets the
last book so sometimes the first big
really imp you definitely get dice
you've been hoping for sometimes the
Lustig's awful because you have to use
some of the jewels you can equip it
around yeah it's really good game I like
a map yeah
again really nice game with the drafting
thing there's a bit of trying to work
out what your opponent's gonna do as
well
if you've gone early you can go well
there's that one that I could play or
that other one that I could play let's
see is anyone else gonna pick those no I
think they're say I'll leave that and
take this other one that I don't need as
much but I'm pretty sure that one's
drinking back
so yeah this
a little bit of kind of psychology in
trying to predict your opponent's moves
as well yeah the whole so many things to
think about about what I can place what
I'm trying to place and not just what
you're placing right now it's going to
allow you to place later so if you have
a square that needs to be yellow you've
got to make sure you know anything
yellow next to it and things like that
so you if you're trying to put different
values in a column you don't want to put
five and a six in that column if you're
if they're not the colors that you score
in the faces aisle because ideally you
want to if you're scoring and I was
growing red if I if I put a blue 5 and a
yellow 6 then it's like a red in that
column it's going to be a forward-most
so that's not going to be as good if I
want to stick either number so yeah all
those kind of things just makes it so
much to think about and it's really good
ok Steve this is a lovely you know
personal game versus a game that I've
wanted for ages this is actually my copy
that I bought myself
my first day so November the 10th
sending out birthday messages that would
be awesome
I think everything that leads to sounds
on me have been said already made by
Steve he's got a really good grasp on
this really nothing much more really
really famous actually a Kickstarter
game which unfortunately missed out on
but God that I that I've been able to
rating outer I'd say it's a solid eight
okay Mac yeah okay the component quality
is great and the game is really well
designed it is a really good game
personally though is brain strain the
whole time I'm thinking I can't put this
there but that's got to go there and I
rather actually followed mass
description earlier but it really feel
that the hallway to I'm gonna do this
with this and I can't do that with that
and I found it just s for all the way
through it's definitely what its gonna
benefit from replay and some people are
gonna love this game he's a really good
game but it was just too much for me I
think I'd be on a six and a half but not
because it's a bad game I just had that
feeling of the the tension all the way
through that was a bit too much for me
personally alright thanks for watching
that was Sagrada

[Applause]
hey everybody Welcome to drive-through
review 586 today we're going to take a
look at Sada now this is from Floodgate
games it's coming out about now and
theide behind this game is that players
are going to be drafting different
colored Dice and placing them into their
own sort of stained glass window and
trying to build up the arrangement of
dice in different ways uh to score the
most points that how you score points is
going to vary from game to game there's
going to be some sort of public
objectives and goals that you're going
after as well as private goals and
things like that and then there's also
some tool cards that will allow you to
kind of mitigate uh the luck of the dice
so let's go ahead and jump right into
how the game actually works and I'll
tell you what I think of it okay here
you can see a few things for the setup
of the game the first thing to not is
each player is going to get a little
stained glass window These are nice the
cardboard here they're going to get one
in different colors and then you're
going to Shuffle Up and Deal out uh
these cards here and you can see these
are double-sided now the couple things
to note about this is you can see these
little Pips here at the bottom it's got
three on this side and then five on this
side and what that means is the number
of favor tokens you're going to get by
selecting that side has a little bit to
do with the difficulty level and the
favor tokens that you get you're going
to spend and activate some of these
special ability cards let's go ahead and
just choose this one here it's got five
and then you're going to slide that in
there like that and then this is going
to give you kind of your layout or your
target layout that you're going for you
so you can see you need a six pip die to
put in there a blue Dy yellow D and so
on you're going to have to arrange those
in different ways and then you're going
to take the number of favor tokens that
are allotted to
you and if you look in the center here
you've got a round tracker here you're
always going to play 10 Rounds you've
got three face up public goals and this
is going to drive the majority of your
scoring here so you can take a look at
this one for example it says color
diagonals so count of diagonally
adjacent of the same color so if you had
two blue adjacent diagonally you know
different ways or yellows you're going
to get points for each of the dice
that's adjacent to a like color here
you're going to want to have a bunch of
threes and fours on your board so for
every pair of those you're going to get
two points you can see that there and
this one is you're going to try to
collect a variety of dice and so there's
five different color dice in the game
and for each set of those you're going
to get four points uh but you can see
this goal here might kind of conflict
with this goal possibly then you've also
got here some special ability cards
these are tool cards these are going to
be different things I'll kind of explain
how those work you can use those during
your turn there's a deck of those here
deck of those special goal cards and
then you have these here with a gray
back these are private goals and these
are all basically the same but they're
going to be for different color colors
so you can see you got one for each of
the different colors and then this is
going to give you points equal to the
Pips of all the yellow dice in that case
or if you have this one it's going to be
all the red dice you're going to try to
go after a certain color dice possibly
uh but that's going to be private so the
way the turn is going to work is whoever
the start players for that round get the
bag of dice they're going to pull out a
certain number of dice based on the
number of players so it's basically two
per player uh plus one so if you're
playing a two- player game You' pull out
five dice and I pulled out six
and then you're going to go ahead and
roll these and put these out here and
then players are going to be able to
draft those and I'll go ahead I was
going to make this comment in the review
but as you can see the color of dice is
very hard to mitigate in this game
that's the one thing you're going to
have to really try to work around and
draft around there's not really a way to
mitigate the actual dice that were drawn
out of the bag but there's abilities and
things like to roll or maybe turn a dice
over and stuff like that but the way the
drafting is going to work is let I I'm
first I'll go ahead and maybe choose
this green die and then Billy will go
and then since we're playing a
two-player game Billy will go again and
then I'll go again maybe grab this other
six and then this die here was going to
be remaining now if you're playing a
three-player game you would have two
more dice out on the table I would go
Billy would go Franchesca would go and
then Franchesca would go Billy would go
and I would go so it's kind of a weird
kind of round robin similar to placing
houses in Katan now the remaining die is
just going to be placed on this board
there and that's just going to be a way
to track the number of rounds now in
addition to drafting a die on your turn
you can spend one of these favorite
tokens optionally uh and activate one of
these cards so you can see these are the
three abilities that we have face up so
for example this one says roll all dice
in the draft pool this may only be used
on your second turn before drafting so
everybody gets a chance to draft so the
way that I would activate this I would
take and put one of my favorite tokens
on there and the first player to do that
for any of these it only costs them one
if somebody else wanted to come and do
this later they would spend these two
and disc them back into the bag and then
that's how that would work so each of
these is going to cost one token to
start and then everybody else after
that's going to be a little bit more
expensive this one allows you to move
any dice that you have on your board
ignoring the color restrictions I'll
talk about the restrictions here and
then this one is after drafting you can
flip the die to the opposite side so
mentioning the restrictions let's talk
about that so on my first turn I have
these two dice here that I drafted what
are the restrictions first of all you've
got to place in a corner to start and
you've also got to match what's
underneath so in this case I draft it a
one I go ahead and put that on there now
the color doesn't matter but in these
other cases the color does matter that's
the only thing that does so I want to
end up with a blue here but once you get
a die that is in a corner then you start
placing adjacent to any dice that you
have pre-existing on the board so I
couldn't like jump up here and grab that
six I have to kind of work out and
you've also got one other restriction
here is you can't have the same color or
thally adjacent to a die and you can't
have the same pip number so if I had
like a six here for example I wouldn't
want to end up placing that there
because I know I need a six here for
example and if I place this six here as
a blue that's tricky cuz I know I need a
blue here and you can't have colors
adjacent or Pips adjacent or fagy you
can place diagonally so if I put here uh
this one green and I got another green d
That's not so bad cuz I can go ahead and
place that there you can place Dag
and there's no really rules there uh but
this is a bad move as well because you
can see I've got a four here and I know
I need a four there to place there so I
wouldn't want to do that so basically
start from the Corner Place adjacent
orthagonal diagonally and then you want
to make sure you don't have colors or
Pips adjacent orthogonally and that's
all the rules there is to it and you're
going to go along you're going to fill
up most of your board usually and any
empty spaces are going to be reduction
in points and then you're going to score
points based on whatever goals were out
and of course the secret goal that you
had in front of you as well you're going
to add up all those points and as you go
along you're going to be filling up this
board here once you get to the 10 Rounds
all the way across just go and flip that
board over and each player has a little
score tracker here and then this will
flip over to the 50 side which hopefully
you have scored more than 50 points cuz
you usually need to do that to win uh
but that's it okay so that is sagata and
let's just get one sort of caveat out of
the way cuz I really do enjoy this game
game we ran into a little bit of an
issue when we played it and that had to
do with kind of two things and they kind
of couped together they kind of one kind
of begets the other so the first thing
that I kind of mentioned during the walk
through are the private goals here you
can see you get points for the Pips on
your yellow dice or your purple dice or
whatever so as you saw in the example in
that first round I pulled out a bunch of
blue dice uh so there was only green and
blue dice in that pole uh there's a lot
of dice in the back
uh and so it's feasible and I've seen it
where maybe you have the yellow uh bonus
and not a lot of yellow dice come out
and not enough come out so that other
players have reason to pick them even
though they don't necessarily know
you're going after yellow to fulfill you
know the different goals on their board
so you might get shafted a little bit in
that particular goal and somebody else
might get a favorable amount of points
they might get very high numbers uh out
of those and they may be in a position
to draft that that's just a little bit
of the luck that's involved there now
the other thing to know is uh you might
start to deduce what somebody else's
color is and that's good because then
you can kind of hate draft that if
you've got a good spot to put it uh but
the rules uh mention that you can
optionally take a die and optionally
activate a special ability on one of the
tool cards but it doesn't say can you
take a die and then you can't place it
and then discard it there's not really
Clarity there and going on board game
geek there wasn't really a whole lot of
clarity there as well and I would say
that's just a variant that you could
play with so you can either say yes you
can take a die even though you cannot
legally place it on your board and then
discard it or you could say you're not
allowed to take a die unless you can
legally take it I don't really know that
that makes that big of a difference to
the game honestly it's just going to be
the game's a little bit meaner or a
little bit less mean or I would say it's
a little bit more interactive and you
can be a little bit more aggressive or
proactive in terms of preventing people
from getting a dice so you maybe you
were getting kind of screwed on you know
the primary goal or the private goal and
you know that Billy over there was going
after purple you're like you know I'm
going to take this purple cuz it's a six
and I'm pretty sure Billy's going after
purple so I'm going to take it and Chuck
it and that just gives you that extra
kind of layer to uh you know to play
around with in terms of your decision
making now just knowing that and I think
it's just it's a little bit of a fault
that it's not very clear but in my mind
I can't really work out which is the
best way to play the game I would play
it either way I'd be happy
uh I'd probably like the fact that you
could take and discard it now forgetting
all that I would say the game's very
very fun it takes about 30 minutes tops
once everybody knows how to play you can
actually play it solo as well I should
have mentioned that uh and I have tried
it solo and it's it's pretty fun it's
actually some cool decision- making in
terms of what you do with kind of the
leftover Dice and because it adds points
to the AI so to speak any leftover dice
go on the round tracker so you don't
want any sixes going on there so that's
kind of interesting as well uh but yeah
there's good decision- making it's very
very quick and the amount of decision-
making that is you know in that tight
time frame uh is really cool uh because
you've got you know the different goals
you've got to really work your way
around uh this card here and you can
really just almost sometimes
accidentally you get kind of so caught
up in scoring one of the goals or
something you realize that well if I do
this here then I'm really going to not
be able to place a die there but that's
only you know minus one Victory Point
how bad is that going to affect me and
and then as over the course of the game
as you start to fill up the board it
gets Tighter and Tighter and Tighter and
then these uh tool cards become more and
more important and you got to really
keep an eye on you know what tools are
out there and how you're going to be
able to sort of maneuver so there's a
lot of uh different ways to play around
sometimes it'll allow you to jump a die
you know over to an empty spade and not
be adjacent so then it gives you kind of
two Avenues and that's really
interesting to play that way cuz you
don't have to go grow out of the same
spot you can kind of grow in different
directions and that's really cool uh the
game looks great it's really cool the
pieces are nice and big and thick um you
know and the dice are nice colored
translucent dice uh so if nothing else
you get a whole bunch of cool dice for a
pretty good deal uh but I really would
recommend the game and I would just say
just kind of know those little caveats
going in so you don't get frustrated
with it uh but I would still recommend
the game even with that kind of uh
unclarity there um but really the one
key I would give you is is really watch
out for uh the colors cuz there's not a
lot of ways to mitigate that initial
draw out of the bag U because the colors
are are what the colors are now once
they're on your board once the dice have
rolled you can mitigate those two areas
but the actual colors coming out um
that's going to be tricky and that's not
always going to necessarily be fair but
you know there's enough else going on in
the game that I think it's almost kind
of nice to have that little bit of a
Anvil over the back of your head because
uh you know it's it's it just has that
little bit of edge to it as well so I
think folks are going to kind of vary
but again the game plays so quickly that
I don't really think it's a problem and
you're going to be able to play it
enough times like say in an hour you
could easily play this three times in an
hour once everybody's familiar with the
flow of it and how to use kind of the
different tools and all that kind of
good stuff once you ingest all that you
can definitely play this you know three
times in an hour I'd say even with four
people uh but I definitely recommend
this game it's it's a great ction it's
very very fun if you don't get too kind
of uptight about how fair things came
out I mean it is a dice game uh then uh
I think you're going to have a great
time with it so that is sagata thanks
